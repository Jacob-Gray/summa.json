                        "Reply to Objection 1: Some, thinking that the \"one\" convertible with \"being\" is the same as the \"one\" which is the principle of number, were divided into contrary opinions. Pythagoras and Plato, seeing that the \"one\" convertible with \"being\" did not add any reality to \"being,\" but signified the substance of \"being\" as undivided, thought that the same applied to the \"one\" which is the principle of number. And because number is composed of unities, they thought that numbers were the substances of all things. Avicenna, however, on the contrary, considering that \"one\" which is the principle of number, added a reality to the substance of \"being\" (otherwise number made of unities would not be a species of quantity), thought that the \"one\" convertible with \"being\" added a reality to the substance of beings; as \"white\" to \"man.\" This, however, is manifestly false, inasmuch as each thing is \"one\" by its substance. For if a thing were \"one\" by anything else but by its substance, since this again would be \"one,\" supposing it were again \"one\" by another thing, we should be driven on to infinity. Hence we must adhere to the former statement; therefore we must say that the \"one\" which is convertible with \"being,\" does not add a reality to being; but that the \"one\" which is the principle of number, does add a reality to \"being,\" belonging to the genus of quantity."

Nevertheless every privation takes away some being; and so in being, by reason of its universality, the privation of being has its foundation in being; which is not the case in privations of special forms, as of sight, or of whiteness and the like. And what applies to being applies also to one and to good, which are convertible with being, for the privation of good is founded in some good; likewise the removal of unity is founded in some one thing. Hence it happens that multitude is some one thing; and evil is some good thing, and non-being is some kind of being. Nevertheless, opposite is not predicated of opposite; forasmuch as one is absolute, and the other is relative; for what is relative being (as a potentiality) is non-being absolutely, i.e. actually; or what is absolute being in the genus of substance is non-being relatively as regards some accidental being.

                        "Reply to Objection 2: \"One\" which is the principle of number is not predicated of God, but only of material things. For \"one\" the principle of number belongs to the \"genus\" of mathematics, which are material in being, and abstracted from matter only in idea. But \"one\" which is convertible with being is a metaphysical entity and does not depend on matter in its being. And although in God there is no privation, still, according to the mode of our apprehension, He is known to us by way only of privation and remotion. Thus there is no reason why a certain kind of privation should not be predicated of God; for instance, that He is incorporeal and infinite; and in the same way it is said of God that He is one."

                "I answer that, It can be shown from these three sources that God is one. First from His simplicity. For it is manifest that the reason why any singular thing is \"this particular thing\" is because it cannot be communicated to many: since that whereby Socrates is a man, can be communicated to many; whereas, what makes him this particular man, is only communicable to one. Therefore, if Socrates were a man by what makes him to be this particular man, as there cannot be many Socrates, so there could not in that way be many men. Now this belongs to God alone; for God Himself is His own nature, as was shown above (Question [3], Article [3]). Therefore, in the very same way God is God, and He is this God. Impossible is it therefore that many Gods should exist.",
                "Secondly, this is proved from the infinity of His perfection. For it was shown above (Question [4], Article [2]) that God comprehends in Himself the whole perfection of being. If then many gods existed, they would necessarily differ from each other. Something therefore would belong to one which did not belong to another. And if this were a privation, one of them would not be absolutely perfect; but if a perfection, one of them would be without it. So it is impossible for many gods to exist. Hence also the ancient philosophers, constrained as it were by truth, when they asserted an infinite principle, asserted likewise that there was only one such principle.",
                "Thirdly, this is shown from the unity of the world. For all things that exist are seen to be ordered to each other since some serve others. But things that are diverse do not harmonize in the same order, unless they are ordered thereto by one. For many are reduced into one order by one better than by many: because one is the \"per se\" cause of one, and many are only the accidental cause of one, inasmuch as they are in some way one. Since therefore what is first is most perfect, and is so \"per se\" and not accidentally, it must be that the first which reduces all into one order should be only one. And this one is God."
