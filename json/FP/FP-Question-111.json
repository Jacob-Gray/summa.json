For the intellect assents to the truth of faith, not as convinced by the reason, but as commanded by the will; hence Augustine says, \"No one believes except willingly.\" In this respect faith comes from God alone. Secondly, faith requires that what is to be believed be proposed to the believer; which is accomplished by man, according to Rm. 10:17, \"Faith cometh by hearing\"; principally, however, by the angels, by whom Divine things are revealed to men. Hence the angels have some part in the enlightenment of faith. Moreover, men are enlightened by the angels not only concerning what is to be believed; but also as regards what is to be done."

This takes place in the angels when the superior angel divides his universal concept of the truth according to the capacity of the inferior angel, as explained above (Question [106], Article [1]).",

Hier. i), that, \"It is impossible for the divine ray to shine on us, otherwise than shrouded by the variety of the sacred veils.\" On the other hand, the human intellect as the inferior, is strengthened by the action of the angelic intellect.

But sometimes by the angelic operation the similitudes of things only appear in the imagination; but neither then is deception caused by the angel, but by the defect in the intellect to whom such things appear. Thus neither was Christ a cause of deception when He spoke many things to the people in parables, which He did not explain to them."

                "I answer that, Both a good and a bad angel by their own natural power can move the human imagination. This may be explained as follows. For it was said above (Question [110], Article [3]), that corporeal nature obeys the angel as regards local movement, so that whatever can be caused by the local movement of bodies is subject to the natural power of the angels. Now it is manifest that imaginative apparitions are sometimes caused in us by the local movement of animal spirits and humors. Hence Aristotle says (De Somn. et Vigil.) [*De Insomniis iii.], when assigning the cause of visions in dreams, that \"when an animal sleeps, the blood descends in abundance to the sensitive principle, and movements descend with it,\" that is, the impressions left from the movements are preserved in the animal spirits, \"and move the sensitive principle\"; so that a certain appearance ensues, as if the sensitive principle were being then changed by the external objects themselves. Indeed, the commotion of the spirits and humors may be so great that such appearances may even occur to those who are awake, as is seen in mad people, and the like. So, as this happens by a natural disturbance of the humors, and sometimes also by the will of man who voluntarily imagines what he previously experienced, so also the same may be done by the power of a good or a bad angel, sometimes with alienation from the bodily senses, sometimes without such alienation."

It expresses, in fact, the effect produced on the people of Sodom---namely, dazzling (French version, \"eblouissement\"), which the Latin \"caecitas\" (blindness) does not necessarily imply.] The same is recorded of the Syrians whom Eliseus led into Samaria (4 Kgs. 6:18)."

Now an angel, by his natural power, can work a change in the senses both ways. For an angel can offer the senses a sensible object from without, formed by nature or by the angel himself, as when he assumes a body, as we have said above (Question [51], Article [2]). Likewise he can move the spirits and humors from within, as above remarked, whereby the senses are changed in various ways."
