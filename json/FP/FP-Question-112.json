                "I answer that, From what has been said above (Question [108], Article [6]), it may be shown that some angels are sent in ministry by God. For, as we have already stated (Question [43], Article [1]), in treating of the mission of the Divine Persons, he is said to be sent who in any way proceeds from another so as to begin to be where he was not, or to be in another way, where he already was. Thus the Son, or the Holy Ghost is said to be sent as proceeding from the Father by origin; and begins to be in a new way, by grace or by the nature assumed, where He was before by the presence of His Godhead; for it belongs to God to be present everywhere, because, since He is the universal agent, His power reaches to all being, and hence He exists in all things (Question [8],  Article [1]). An angel's power, however, as a particular agent, does not reach to the whole universe, but reaches to one thing in such a way as not to reach another; and so he is \"here\" in such a manner as not to be \"there.\" But it is clear from what was above stated (Question [110], Article [1]), that the corporeal creature is governed by the angels. Hence, whenever an angel has to perform any work concerning a corporeal creature, the angel applies himself anew to that body by his power; and in that way begins to be there afresh. Now all this takes place by Divine command. Hence it follows that an angel is sent by God.",
                "Yet the action performed by the angel who is sent, proceeds from God as from its first principle, at Whose nod and by Whose authority the angels work; and is reduced to God as to its last end. Now this is what is meant by a minister: for a minister is an intelligent instrument; while an instrument is moved by another, and its action is ordered to another. Hence angels' actions are called 'ministries'; and for this reason they are said to be sent in ministry."

But the Divine dispensation, however, this order is sometimes departed from as regards corporeal things, for the sake of a higher order, that is, according as it is suitable for the manifestation of grace. That the man born blind was enlightened, that Lazarus was raised from the dead, was accomplished immediately by God without the action of the heavenly bodies. Moreover both good and bad angels can work some effect in these bodies independently of the heavenly bodies, by the condensation of the clouds to rain, and by producing some such effects. Nor can anyone doubt that God can immediately reveal things to men without the help of the angels, and the superior angels without the inferior. From this standpoint some have said that according to the general law the superior angels are not sent, but only the inferior; yet that sometimes, by Divine dispensation, the superior angels also are sent.",

                        "Reply to Objection 2: A twofold reason may be given in assigning the number of the assisting and ministering angels. For Gregory says that those who minister are more numerous than those who assist; because he takes the words (Dan. 7:10) \"thousands of thousands ministered to Him,\" not in a multiple but in a partitive sense, to mean \"thousands out of thousands\"; thus the number of those who minister is indefinite, and signifies excess; while the number of assistants is finite as in the words added, \"and ten thousand times a hundred thousand assisted Him.\" This explanation rests on the opinion of the Platonists, who said that the nearer things are to the one first principle, the smaller they are in number; as the nearer a number is to unity, the lesser it is than multitude. This opinion is verified as regards the number of orders, as six administer and three assist.",
                        "Dionysius, however, (Coel. Hier. xiv) declares that the multitude of angels surpasses all the multitude of material things; so that, as the superior bodies exceed the inferior in magnitude to an immeasurable degree, so the superior incorporeal natures surpass all corporeal natures in multitude; because whatever is better is more intended and more multiplied by God. Hence, as the assistants are superior to the ministers there will be more assistants than ministers. In this way, the words \"thousands of thousands\" are taken by way of multiplication, to signify \"a thousand times a thousand.\" And because ten times a hundred is a thousand, if it  were said \"ten times a hundred thousand\" it would mean that there are as many assistants as ministers: but since it is written \"ten thousand times a hundred thousand,\" we are given to understand that the assistants are much more numerous than the ministers. Nor is this said to signify that this is the precise number of angels, but rather that it is much greater, in that it exceeds all material multitude. This is signified by the multiplication together of all the greatest numbers, namely ten, a hundred, and a thousand, as Dionysius remarks in the same passage."

Now the angelic properties are manifested by their names, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. vii); and therefore the angels of those orders are sent to external ministry whose names signify some kind of administration. But the name \"dominations\" does not signify any such administration, but only disposition and command in administering. On the other hand, the names of the inferior orders imply administration, for the \"Angels\" and \"Archangels\" are so called from \"announcing\"; the \"Virtues\" and \"Powers\" are so called in respect of some act; and it is right that the \"Prince,\" according to what Gregory says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.), \"be first among the workers.\" Hence it belongs to these five orders to be sent to external ministry; not to the four superior orders."
