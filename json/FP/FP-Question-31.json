For we can say, \"Only Socrates\"---that is, no one else---\"runs: and Socrates runs only\"---that is, he does nothing else. Hence it is not properly said that the Father is God alone, or the Trinity is God alone, unless some implied meaning be assumed in the predicate, as, for  instance, \"The Trinity is God Who alone is God.\" In that sense it can be true to say that the Father is that God Who alone is God, if the relative be referred to the predicate, and not to the \"suppositum.\" So, when Augustine says that the Father is not God alone, but that the Trinity is God alone, he speaks expositively, as he might explain the words, \"To the King of ages, invisible, the only God,\" as applying not to the Father, but to the Trinity alone."

A categorematical term is one which ascribes absolutely its meaning to a given \"suppositum\"; as, for instance, \"white\" to man, as when we say a \"white man.\" If the term \"alone\" is taken in this sense, it cannot in any way be joined to any term in God; for it would mean solitude in the term to which it is joined; and it would follow that God was solitary, against what is above stated (Article [2]). A syncategorematical term imports the order of the predicate to the subject; as this expression \"every one\" or \"no one\"; and likewise the term \"alone,\" as excluding every other \"suppositum\" from the predicate. Thus, when we say, \"Socrates alone writes,\" we do not mean that Socrates is solitary, but that he has no companion in writing, though many others may be with him. In this way nothing prevents the term \"alone\" being joined to any essential term in God, as excluding the predicate from all things but God; as if we said \"God alone is eternal,\" because nothing but God is eternal."

For if it exclude (all others) from the form of the subject, it is true, the sense being \"the Father alone is God\"---that is, \"He who with no other is the Father, is God.\" In this way Augustine expounds when he says (De Trin. vi, 6): \"We say the Father alone, not because He is separate from the Son, or from the Holy Ghost, but because they are not the Father together with Him.\" This, however, is not the usual way of speaking, unless we understand another implication, as though we said \"He who alone is called the Father is God.\" But in the strict sense the exclusion affects the predicate. And thus the proposition is false if it excludes another in the masculine sense; but true if it excludes it in the neuter sense; because the Son is another person than the Father, but not another thing; and the same applies to the Holy Ghost.
