Now the wider a term is, the more suitable it is to use as regards God (Question [13], Article [11]), because the more special terms are, the more they determine the mode adapted to the creature. Hence this term \"cause\" seems to mean diversity of substance, and dependence of one from another; which is not implied in the word \"principle.\" For in all kinds of causes there is always to be found between the cause and the effect a distance of perfection or of power: whereas we use the term \"principle\" even in things which have no such difference, but have only a certain order to each other; as when we say that a  point is the principle of a line; or also when we say that the first part of a line is the principle of a line."

Hence also the Apostle says, \"I bend my knee to the Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, from whom all paternity in heaven and on earth is named\" (Eph. 3:14). This is explained thus. It is manifest that generation receives its species from the term which is the form of the thing generated; and the nearer it is to the form of the generator, the truer and more perfect is the generation; as univocal generation is more perfect than non-univocal, for it belongs to the essence of a generator to generate what is like itself in form. Hence the very fact that in the divine generation the form of the Begetter and Begotten is numerically the same, whereas in creatures it is not numerically, but only specifically, the same, shows that generation, and consequently paternity, is applied to God before creatures.

Hence this name \"lion\" is applied first to the animal containing the whole nature of a lion, and which is properly so called, before it is applied to a man who shows something of a lion's nature, as courage, or strength, or the like; and of whom it is said by way of similitude.",
                "Now it is manifest from the foregoing (Question [27], Article [2]; Question [28], Article [4]), that the perfect idea of paternity and filiation is to be found in God the Father, and in God the Son, because one is the nature and glory of the Father and the Son. But in the creature, filiation is found in relation to God, not in a perfect manner, since the Creator and the creature have not the same nature; but by way of a certain likeness, which is the more perfect the nearer we approach to the true idea of filiation. For God is called the Father of some creatures, by reason only of a trace, for instance of irrational creatures, according to Job 38:28: \"Who is the father of the rain? or who begot the drops of dew?\" Of some, namely, the rational creature (He is the Father), by reason of the likeness of His image, according to Dt. 32:6: \"Is He not thy Father, who possessed, and made, and created thee?\" And of others He is the Father by similitude of grace, and these are also called adoptive sons, as ordained to the heritage of eternal glory by the gift of grace  which they have received, according to Rm. 8:16,17: \"The Spirit Himself gives testimony to our spirit that we are the sons of God; and if sons, heirs also.\" Lastly, He is the Father of others by similitude of glory, forasmuch as they have obtained possession of the heritage of glory, according to Rm. 5:2: \"We glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.\" Therefore it is plain that \"paternity\" is applied to God first, as importing regard of one Person to another Person, before it imports the regard of God to creatures."

This, however, does not seem true, because thus innascibility would not be a property distinct from paternity and spiration; but would include them as the proper is included in the common. For source and authority signify in God nothing but the principle of origin. We must therefore say with Augustine (De Trin. v, 7) that \"unbegotten\" imports the negation of passive generation. For he says that \"unbegotten\" has the same meaning as \"not a son.\" Nor  does it follow that \"unbegotten\" is not the proper notion of the Father; for primary and simple things are notified by negations; as, for instance, a point is defined as what has no part."

Otherwise \"unbegotten\" may be taken in a kind of privation sense, but not as implying any imperfection. For privation can be taken in many ways; in one way when a thing has not what is naturally belongs to another, even though it is not of its own nature to have it; as, for instance, if a stone be called a dead thing, as wanting life, which naturally belongs to some other things. In another sense, privation is so called when something has not what naturally belongs to some members of its genus; as for instance when a mole is called blind. In a third sense privation means the absence of what something ought to have; in which sense, privation imports an imperfection. In this sense, \"unbegotten\" is not attributed to the Father as a privation, but it may be so attributed in the second sense, meaning that a certain person of the divine nature is not begotten, while some person of the same nature is begotten. In this sense the term \"unbegotten\" can be applied also to the Holy Ghost. Hence to consider it as a term proper to the Father alone, it must be further understood that the name \"unbegotten\" belongs to a divine person as the principle of another person; so that it be understood to imply negation in the genus of principle taken personally in God. Or that there be understood in the term \"unbegotten\" that He is not in any way derived from another; and not only that He is not from another by way only of generation. In this sense the term \"unbegotten\" does not belong at all to the Holy Ghost, Who is from another by procession, as a subsisting person; nor does it belong to the divine essence, of which it may be said that it is in the Son or in the Holy Ghost from another---namely, from the Father."
