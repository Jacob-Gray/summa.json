For no name which is common to the three persons is the proper name of any one person. But this name of 'Holy Ghost' [*It should be borne in mind that the word \"ghost\" is the old English equivalent for the Latin \"spiritus,\" whether in the sense of \"breath\" or \"blast,\" or in the sense of \"spirit,\" as an immaterial substance. Thus, we read in the former  sense (Hampole, Psalter x, 7), \"The Gost of Storms\" [spiritus procellarum], and in the latter \"Trubled gost is sacrifice of God\" (Prose Psalter, A.D. 1325), and \"Oure wrestlynge is . . . against the spiritual wicked gostes of the ayre\" (More, \"Comfort against Tribulation\"); and in our modern expression of \"giving up the ghost.\" As applied to God, and not specially to the third Holy Person, we have an example from Maunder, \"Jhesu Criste was the worde and the goste of Good.\" (See Oxford Dictionary).] is common to the three persons; for Hilary (De Trin. viii) shows that the \"Spirit of God\" sometimes means the Father, as in the words of Is. 61:1: \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me;\" and sometimes the Son, as when the Son says: \"In the Spirit of God I cast out devils\" (Mt. 12:28), showing that He cast out devils by His own natural power; and that sometimes it means the Holy Ghost, as in the words of Joel 2:28: \"I will pour out of My Spirit over all flesh.\" Therefore this name 'Holy Ghost' is not the proper name of a divine person."

                "I answer that, While there are two processions in God, one of these, the procession of love, has no proper name of its own, as stated above (Question [27], Article [4], ad 3). Hence the relations also which follow from this procession are without a name (Question [28], Article [4]): for which reason the Person proceeding in that manner has not a proper name. But as some names are accommodated by the usual mode of speaking to signify the aforesaid relations, as when we use the names of procession and spiration, which in the strict sense more fittingly signify the notional acts than the relations; so to signify the divine Person, Who proceeds by way of love, this name \"Holy Ghost\" is by the use of scriptural speech accommodated to Him. The appropriateness of this name may be shown in two ways. Firstly, from the fact that the person who is called \"Holy Ghost\" has something in common with the other Persons. For, as Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 17; v, 11), \"Because the Holy Ghost is common to both, He Himself is called that properly which both are called in common. For the Father also is a spirit, and the Son is a spirit; and the Father is holy, and the Son is holy.\" Secondly, from the  proper signification of the name. For the name spirit in things corporeal seems to signify impulse and motion; for we call the breath and the wind by the term spirit. Now it is a property of love to move and impel the will of the lover towards the object loved. Further, holiness is attributed to whatever is ordered to God. Therefore because the divine person proceeds by way of the love whereby God is loved, that person is most properly named \"The Holy Ghost.\""

It is also a rule of Holy Scripture that whatever is said of the Father, applies to the Son, although there be added an exclusive term; except only as regards what belongs to the opposite relations, whereby the Father and the Son are distinguished from each other.

                "I answer that, It must be said that the Holy Ghost is from the Son. For if He were not from Him, He could in no wise be personally distinguished from Him; as appears from what has been said above (Question [28], Article [3]; Question [30], Article [2]). For it cannot be said that the divine Persons are distinguished from each other in any absolute sense; for it would follow that there would not be one essence of the three persons: since everything that is spoken of God in an absolute sense, belongs to the unity of essence. Therefore it must be said that the divine persons are distinguished from each other only by the relations. Now the relations cannot distinguish the persons except forasmuch as they are opposite relations; which appears from the fact that the Father has two relations, by one of which He is related to the Son, and by the other to the Holy Ghost; but these are not opposite relations, and therefore they do not make two persons, but belong only to the one person of the Father. If therefore in the Son and the Holy Ghost there were two relations  only, whereby each of them were related to the Father, these relations would not be opposite to each other, as neither would be the two relations whereby the Father is related to them. Hence, as the person of the Father is one, it would follow that the person of the Son and of the Holy Ghost would be one, having two relations opposed to the two relations of the Father. But this is heretical since it destroys the Faith in the Trinity. Therefore the Son and the Holy Ghost must be related to each other by opposite relations. Now there cannot be in God any relations opposed to each other, except relations of origin, as proved above (Question [28], Article [44]). And opposite relations of origin are to be understood as of a \"principle,\" and of what is \"from the principle.\" Therefore we must conclude that it is necessary to say that either the Son is from the Holy Ghost; which no one says; or that the Holy Ghost is from the Son, as we confess.",
                "Furthermore, the order of the procession of each one agrees with this conclusion. For it was said above (Question [27], Articles [2],4; Question [28], Article [4]), that the Son proceeds by the way of the intellect as Word, and the Holy Ghost by way of the will as Love. Now love must proceed from a word. For we do not love anything unless we apprehend it by a mental conception. Hence also in this way it is manifest that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son.",
                "We derive a knowledge of the same truth from the very order of nature itself. For we nowhere find that several things proceed from one without order except in those which differ only by their matter; as for instance one smith produces many knives distinct from each other materially, with no order to each other; whereas in things in which there is not only a material distinction we always find that some order exists in the multitude produced. Hence also in the order of creatures produced, the beauty of the divine wisdom is displayed. So if from the one Person of the Father, two persons proceed, the Son and the Holy Ghost, there must be some order between them. Nor can any other be assigned except the order of their nature, whereby one is from the other. Therefore it cannot be said that the Son and the Holy Ghost proceed from the Father in such a way as that neither of them proceeds from the other, unless we admit in them a material distinction; which is impossible.",
                "Hence also the Greeks themselves recognize that the procession of the Holy Ghost has some order to the Son. For they grant that the Holy Ghost is the Spirit \"of the Son\"; and that He is from the Father \"through the Son.\" Some of them are said also to concede that \"He is from the Son\"; or that \"He flows from the Son,\" but not that He proceeds; which seems to come from ignorance or obstinacy. For a just consideration of the truth will convince anyone that the word procession is the one most commonly applied to all that denotes origin of any kind. For we use the term to describe any kind of origin; as when we say that a line proceeds from a point, a ray from the sun, a stream from a source, and likewise in everything else. Hence, granted that the Holy Ghost originates in any way from the Son, we can conclude that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son."

The bailiff is, however, said to act through the king, although this preposition \"through\" denotes a medium, for the more a \"suppositum\" is prior in action, so much the more is its power immediate as regards the effect, inasmuch as the power of the first cause joins the second cause to its effect. Hence also first principles are said to be immediate in the demonstrative sciences. Therefore, so far as the bailiff is a medium according to the order of the subject's acting, the king is said to work through the bailiff; but according to the order of powers, the bailiff is said to act through the king, forasmuch as the power of the king gives the bailiff's action its effect.

But if we consider the \"supposita\" of the spiration, then we may say that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son, as distinct; for He proceeds from them as the unitive love of both."

Yet this does not hold good as to the name \"Creator\"; because the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son as from two distinct persons, as above explained; whereas the creature proceeds from the three persons not as distinct persons, but as united in essence. It seems, however, better to say that because spirating is an adjective, and spirator a substantive, we can say that the Father and the Son are two spirating, by reason of the plurality of the \"supposita\" but not two spirators by reason of the one spiration. For adjectival words derive their number from the \"supposita\" but substantives from themselves, according to the form signified. As to what Hilary says, that \"the Holy ghost is from the Father and the Son as His authors,\" this is to be explained in the sense that the substantive here stands for the adjective."

But then it might be equally right to say that the Father is two principles of the Son and of the Holy Ghost---namely, in two ways. Therefore, we must say that, although this word \"principle\" signifies a property, it does so after the manner of a substantive, as do the words \"father\" and \"son\" even in things created. Hence it takes its number from the form it signifies, like other substantives. Therefore, as the Father and the Son are one God, by reason of the unity of the form that is signified by this word \"God\"; so they are one principle of the Holy Ghost by reason of the unity of the property that is signified in this word \"principle.\""
