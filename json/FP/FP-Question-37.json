                "To see this we must know that since as shown above (Question [27], Articles [2],3,4,5), there are two processions in God, one by way of the intellect, which is the procession of the Word, and another by way of the will, which is the procession of Love; forasmuch as the former is the more known to us, we have been able to apply more suitable names to express our various considerations as regards that procession, but not as regards the procession of the will. Hence, we are obliged to employ circumlocution as regards the person Who proceeds, and the relations following from this procession which are called \"procession\" and \"spiration,\" as stated above (Question [27], Article [4], ad 3), and yet express the origin rather than the relation in the strict sense of the term. Nevertheless we must consider them in respect of each procession simply. For as when a thing is understood by anyone, there results in the one who understands a conception of the object understood, which conception we call word; so when anyone loves an object, a certain impression results, so to speak, of the thing loved in the affection of the lover; by reason of which the object loved is said to be in the lover; as also the thing understood is in the one who understands; so that when anyone understands and loves himself he is in himself, not only by real identity, but also as the object understood is in the one who understands, and the thing loved is in the lover. As regards the intellect, however, words have been found to describe the mutual relation of the one who understands the object understood, as appears in the word \"to understand\"; and other words are used to express the procession of the intellectual conception---namely, \"to speak,\" and \"word.\" Hence in God, \"to understand\" is applied only to the essence; because it does not import relation to the Word that proceeds; whereas \"Word\" is said personally, because it signifies what proceeds; and the term \"to speak\" is a notional term as importing the relation of the principle of the Word to the Word Himself. On the other hand, on the part of the will, with the exception of the words \"dilection\" and \"love,\" which express the relation of the lover to the object loved, there are no other terms in use, which express the relation of the impression or affection of the object loved, produced in the lover by fact that he loves---to the principle of that impression, or \"vice versa.\" And therefore, on account of the poverty of our vocabulary, we express these relations by the words \"love\" and \"dilection\": just as if we were to call the Word \"intelligence conceived,\" or \"wisdom begotten.\"",
                "It follows that so far as love means only the relation of the lover to the object loved, \"love\" and \"to love\" are said of the essence, as \"understanding\" and \"to understand\"; but, on the other hand, so far as these words are used to express the relation to its principle, of what proceeds by way of love, and \"vice versa,\" so that by \"love\" is understood the \"love proceeding,\" and by \"to love\" is understood \"the spiration of the love proceeding,\" in that sense \"love\" is the name of the person and \"to love\" is a notional term, as \"to speak\" and \"to beget.\""

                "In view of this difficulty some have held that it is false, that \"the Father and the Son love each other by the Holy Ghost\"; and they add that it was retracted by Augustine when he retracted its equivalent to the effect that \"the Father is wise by the Wisdom begotten.\" Others say that the proposition is inaccurate and ought to be expounded, as that \"the Father loves the Son by the Holy Ghost\"---that is, \"by His essential Love,\" which is appropriated to the Holy Ghost. Others further say that this ablative should be construed as importing a sign, so that it means, \"the Holy Ghost is the sign that the Father loves the Son\"; inasmuch as the Holy Ghost proceeds from them both, as Love. Others, again, say that this ablative must be construed as importing the relation of formal cause, because the Holy Ghost is the love whereby the Father and the Son formally love each other. Others, again, say that it should be construed as importing the relation of a formal effect; and these approach nearer to the truth.",
                "To make the matter clear, we must consider that since a thing is commonly denominated from its forms, as \"white\" from whiteness, and \"man\" from humanity; everything whence anything is denominated, in this particular respect stands to that thing in the relation of form. So when I say, \"this man is clothed with a garment,\" the ablative is to be construed as having relation to the formal cause, although the garment is not the form. Now it may happen that a thing may be denominated from that which proceeds from it, not only as an agent is from its action, but also as from the term itself of the action---that is, the effect, when the effect itself is included in the idea of the action. For we say that fire warms by heating, although heating is not the heat which is the form of the fire, but is an action proceeding from the fire; and we say that a tree flowers with the flower, although the flower is not the tree's form, but is the effect proceeding from the form. In this way, therefore, we must say that since in God \"to love\" is taken in two ways, essentially and notionally, when it is taken essentially, it means that the Father and the Son love each other not by the Holy Ghost, but by their essence. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 7): \"Who dares to say that the Father loves neither Himself, nor the Son, nor the Holy Ghost, except by the Holy Ghost?\" The opinions first quoted are to be taken in this sense. But when the term Love  is taken in a notional sense it means nothing else than \"to spirate love\"; just as to speak is to produce a word, and to flower is to produce flowers. As therefore we say that a tree flowers by its flower, so do we say that the Father, by the Word or the Son, speaks Himself, and His creatures; and that the Father and the Son love each other and us, by the Holy Ghost, or by Love proceeding."
