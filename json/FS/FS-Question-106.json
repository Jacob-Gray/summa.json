Thus with regard to the intellect, the Gospel contains certain matters pertaining to the manifestation of Christ's Godhead or humanity, which dispose us by means of faith through which we receive the grace of the Holy Ghost: and with regard to the affections, it contains matters touching the contempt of the world, whereby man is rendered fit to receive the grace of the Holy Ghost: for \"the world,\" i.e. worldly men, \"cannot receive\" the Holy Ghost (Jn. 14:17). As to the use of spiritual grace, this consists in works of virtue to which the writings of the New Testament exhort men in divers ways."

For the Apostle, quoting the authority of Jeremias 31:31,33: \"Behold the days shall come, saith the Lord; and I will perfect unto the house of Israel, and unto the house of Judah, a new testament,\" says, explaining what this statement is (Heb. 8:8,10): \"For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel . . . by giving [Vulg.: 'I will give'] My laws into their mind, and in their heart will I write them.\" Therefore the New Law is instilled in our hearts."

                "I answer that, \"Each thing appears to be that which preponderates in it,\" as the Philosopher states (Ethic. ix, 8). Now that which is preponderant in the law of the New Testament, and whereon all its efficacy is based, is the grace of the Holy Ghost, which is given through faith in Christ. Consequently the New Law is  chiefly the grace itself of the Holy Ghost, which is given to those who believe in Christ. This is manifestly stated by the Apostle who says (Rm. 3:27): \"Where is . . . thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith\": for he calls the grace itself of faith \"a law.\" And still more clearly it is written (Rm. 8:2): \"The law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath delivered me from the law of sin and of death.\" Hence Augustine says (De Spir. et Lit. xxiv) that \"as the law of deeds was written on tables of stone, so is the law of faith inscribed on the hearts of the faithful\": and elsewhere, in the same book (xxi): \"What else are the Divine laws written by God Himself on our hearts, but the very presence of His Holy Spirit?\"",
                "Nevertheless the New Law contains certain things that dispose us to receive the grace of the Holy Ghost, and pertaining to the use of that grace: such things are of secondary importance, so to speak, in the New Law; and the faithful need to be instructed concerning them, both by word and writing, both as to what they should believe and as to what they should do. Consequently we must say that the New Law is in the first place a law that is inscribed on our hearts, but that secondarily it is a written law."

And as to this, the New Law does not justify. Hence the Apostle says (2 Cor. 3:6) \"The letter killeth, but the spirit quickeneth\": and Augustine explains this (De Spir. et Lit. xiv, xvii) by saying that the letter denotes any writing external to man, even that of the moral precepts such as are contained in the Gospel.

            "body": [
                "I answer that, Three reasons may be assigned why it was not fitting for the New Law to be given from the beginning of the world. The first is because the New Law, as stated above (Article [1]), consists chiefly in the grace of the Holy Ghost: which it behoved not to be given abundantly until sin, which is an obstacle to  grace, had been cast out of man through the accomplishment of his redemption by Christ: wherefore it is written (Jn. 7:39): \"As yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.\" This reason the Apostle states clearly (Rm. 8:2, seqq.) where, after speaking of \"the Law of the Spirit of life,\" he adds: \"God sending His own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, of sin* hath condemned sin in the flesh, that the justification of the Law might be fulfilled in us.\" [*St. Thomas, quoting perhaps from memory, omits the \"et\" (and), after \"sinful flesh.\" The text quoted should read thus: \"in the likeness of sinful flesh, and a sin offering ({peri hamartias}), hath,\" etc.]",
                "A second reason may be taken from the perfection of the New Law. Because a thing is not brought to perfection at once from the outset, but through an orderly succession of time; thus one is at first a boy, and then a man. And this reason is stated by the Apostle (Gal. 3:24,25): \"The Law was our pedagogue in Christ that we might be justified by faith. But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.\"",
                "The third reason is found in the fact that the New Law is the law of grace: wherefore it behoved man first of all to be left to himself under the state of the Old Law, so that through falling into sin, he might realize his weakness, and acknowledge his need of grace. This reason is set down by the Apostle (Rm. 5:20): \"The Law entered in, that sin might abound: and when sin abounded grace did more abound.\""

In like manner the Manicheans maintained that it was fulfilled in Manes whom they held to be the Paraclete. Hence none of the above received the Acts of the Apostles, where it is clearly shown that the aforesaid promise was fulfilled in the apostles: just as Our Lord promised them a second time (Acts 1:5): \"You shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence\": which we read as having been fulfilled in Acts 2. However, these foolish notions are refuted by the statement (Jn. 7:39) that \"as yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified\"; from which we gather that the Holy Ghost was given as soon as Christ was glorified in His Resurrection and Ascension. Moreover, this puts out of court the senseless idea that the Holy Ghost is to be expected to come at some other time.",

But the preaching of the Gospel of Christ may be understood in two ways. First, as denoting the spreading abroad of the knowledge of Christ: and thus the Gospel was preached throughout the world even at the time of the apostles, as Chrysostom states (Hom. lxxv in Matth.). And in this sense the words that follow---\"and then shall the consummation come,\" refer to the destruction of Jerusalem, of which He was speaking literally. Secondly, the preaching of the Gospel may be understood as extending throughout the world and producing its full effect, so that, to wit, the Church would be founded in every nation. And in these sense, as Augustine writes to Hesychius (Epist. cxcix), the Gospel is not preached to the whole world yet, but, when it is, the consummation of the world will come."

Because the state of the New Law succeeded the state of the Old Law, as a more perfect law a less perfect one. Now no state of the present life can be more perfect that the state of the New Law: since nothing can approach nearer to the last end than that which is the immediate cause of our being brought to the last end. But the New Law does this: wherefore the Apostle says (Heb. 10:19-22): \"Having therefore, brethren, a confidence in the entering into the Holies by the blood of Christ, a new . . . way which He hath dedicated for us . . . let us draw near.\" Therefore no state of the present life can be more perfect than that of the New Law, since the nearer a thing is to the last end the more perfect it is.",

And thus the state of the Old Law underwent frequent changes, since at times the laws were very well kept, and at other times were altogether unheeded. Thus, too, the state of the New Law is subject to change with regard to various places, times, and persons, according as the grace of the Holy Ghost dwells in man more or less perfectly. Nevertheless we are not to look forward to a state wherein man is to possess the grace of the Holy Ghost more perfectly than he has possessed it hitherto, especially the apostles who \"received the firstfruits of the Spirit, i.e. sooner and more abundantly than others,\" as a gloss expounds on Rm. 8:23."
