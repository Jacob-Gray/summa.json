For if while observing other due circumstances one were to wish to please a person by praising him, in order thereby to console him, or that he may strive to make progress in good, this will belong to the aforesaid virtue of friendship. But it would belong to flattery, if one wished to praise a person for things in which he ought not to be praised; since perhaps they are evil, according to Ps. 9:24, \"The sinner is praised in the desires of his soul\"; or they may be uncertain, according to Ecclus. 27:8, \"Praise not a man before he speaketh,\" and again (Ecclus. 11:2), \"Praise not a man for his beauty\"; or because there may be fear lest human praise should  incite him to vainglory, wherefore it is written, (Ecclus. 11:30), \"Praise not any man before death.\" Again, in like manner it is right to wish to please a man in order to foster charity, so that he may make spiritual progress therein. But it would be sinful to wish to please men for the sake of vainglory or gain, or to please them in something evil, according to Ps. 52:6, \"God hath scattered the bones of them that please men,\" and according to the words of the Apostle (Gal. 1:10), \"If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.\""

Accordingly, if a man were to wish always to speak pleasantly to others, he would exceed the mode of pleasing, and would therefore sin by excess. If he do this with the mere intention of pleasing he is said to be \"complaisant,\" according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 6): whereas if he do it with the intention of making some gain out of it, he is called a \"flatterer\" or \"adulator.\" As a rule, however, the term \"flattery\" is wont to be applied to all who wish to exceed the mode of virtue in pleasing others by words or deeds in their ordinary behavior towards their fellows."

                "I answer that, As stated above (Question [112], Article [2]), a mortal sin is one that is contrary to charity. Now flattery is sometimes contrary to charity and sometimes not. It is contrary to charity in three ways. First, by reason of the very matter, as when one man praises another's sin: for this is contrary to the love of God, against Whose justice he speaks, and contrary to the love of his neighbor, whom he encourages to sin. Wherefore this is a mortal sin, according to Is. 5:20. \"Woe to you that call evil good.\" Secondly, by reason of the intention, as when one man flatters another, so that by deceiving him he may injure him in body or in soul; this is also a mortal sin, and of this it is written (Prov. 27:6): \"Better are the wounds of a friend than the deceitful kisses of an enemy.\" Thirdly, by way of occasion, as when the praise of a flatterer, even without his intending it, becomes to another an occasion of sin. In this case it is necessary to consider, whether the occasion were given or taken, and how grievous the consequent downfall, as may be understood from what has been said above concerning scandal (Question [43], Articles [3],4). If, however, one man flatters another from the mere craving to please others, or again in order to avoid some evil, or to acquire something in a case of necessity, this is not contrary to charity. Consequently it is not a mortal but a venial sin."
