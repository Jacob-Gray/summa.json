For covetousness [avaritia] denotes a certain greed for gold [aeris aviditas*], because, to wit, it consists in a desire for money, under which all external goods may be comprised. [*The Latin for covetousness \"avaritia\" is derived from \"aveo\" to desire; but the Greek {philargyria} signifies literally \"love of money\": and it is to this that St. Thomas is alluding (cf. Article [2], Objection [2])]. Now it is not a sin to desire external goods: since man desires them naturally, both because they are naturally subject to man, and because by their means man's life is sustained (for which reason they are spoken of as his substance). Therefore covetousness is not a sin."

In this way it is a sin directly against one's neighbor, since one man cannot over-abound in external riches, without another man lacking them, for temporal goods cannot be possessed by many at the same time. Secondly, it may signify immoderation in the internal affection which a man has for riches when, for instance, a man loves them, desires them, or delights in them, immoderately.

External goods come under the head of things useful for an end, as stated above (Question [117], Article [3]; FS, Question [2], Article [1]). Hence it must needs be that man's good in their respect consists in a certain measure, in other words, that man seeks, according to a certain measure, to have external riches, in so far as they are necessary for him to live in keeping with his condition of life. Wherefore it will be a sin for him to exceed this measure, by wishing to acquire or keep them immoderately. This is what is meant by covetousness, which is defined as \"immoderate love of possessing.\" It is therefore evident that covetousness is a sin."

Thus Gregory says in a homily (xvi in Ev.) that \"covetousness is a desire not only for money, but also for knowledge and high places, when prominence is immoderately sought  after.\" In this way covetousness is not a special sin: and in this sense Augustine speaks of covetousness in the passage quoted in the First Objection.

                "I answer that, Covetousness denotes immoderation with regard to riches in two ways. First, immediately in respect of the acquisition and keeping of riches. In this way a man obtains money beyond his due, by stealing or retaining another's property. This is opposed to justice, and in this sense covetousness is mentioned (Ezech. 22:27): \"Her princes in the midst of her are like wolves  ravening the prey to shed blood . . . and to run after gains through covetousness.\" Secondly, it denotes immoderation in the interior affections for riches; for instance, when a man loves or desires riches too much, or takes too much pleasure in them, even if he be unwilling to steal. In this way covetousness is opposed to liberality, which moderates these affections, as stated above (Question [117], Article [2], ad 3, Article [3], ad 3, Article [6]). In this sense covetousness is spoken of (2 Cor. 9:5): \"That they would . . . prepare this blessing before promised, to be ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness,\" where a gloss observes: \"Lest they should regret what they had given, and give but little.\""

Accordingly if the love of riches becomes so great as to be preferred to charity, in such wise that a man, through love of riches, fear not to act counter to the love of God and his neighbor, covetousness will then be a mortal sin. If, on the other hand, the inordinate nature of his love stops short of this, so that although he love riches too much, yet he does not prefer the love of them to the love of God, and is unwilling for the sake of riches to do anything in opposition to God or his neighbor, then covetousness is a venial sin."

Consequently the order of sins may be considered in two ways. First, on the part of the good that is despised or corrupted by sin, and then the greater the good the graver the sin. From this point of view a sin that is against God is most grievous; after this comes a sin that is committed against a man's person, and after this comes a sin against external things, which are deputed to man's use, and this seems to belong to covetousness. Secondly, the degrees of sin may be considered on the part of the good to which the human appetite is inordinately subjected; and then the lesser the good, the more deformed is the sin: for it is more shameful to be subject to a lower than to a higher good. Now the good of external things is the lowest of human goods: since it is less than the good of the body, and this is less than the good of the soul, which is less than the Divine good. From this point of view the sin of covetousness, whereby the human appetite is subjected even to external things, has in a way a greater deformity. Since, however, corruption or privation of good is the formal element in sin, while conversion to a mutable good is the material element, the gravity of the sin is to be judged from the point of view of the good corrupted, rather than from that of the good to which the appetite is subjected. Hence we must assert that covetousness is not simply the most grievous of sins."

Now some pleasures are carnal and some spiritual. Carnal pleasures are those which are consummated in the carnal senses---for instance, the pleasures of the table and sexual pleasures: while spiritual pleasures are those which are consummated in the mere apprehension of the soul. Accordingly, sins of the flesh are those which are consummated in carnal pleasures, while spiritual sins are consummated in pleasures of the spirit without pleasure of the flesh. Such is covetousness: for the covetous man takes pleasure in the consideration of himself as a possessor of riches. Therefore covetousness is a spiritual sin."

Now the most desirable end is happiness or felicity, which is the last end of human life, as stated above (FS, Question [1], Articles [4],7,8): wherefore the more a thing is furnished with the conditions of happiness, the more desirable it is. Also one of the conditions of happiness is that it be self-sufficing, else it would not set man's appetite at rest, as the last end does. Now riches give great promise of self-sufficiency, as Boethius says (De Consol. iii): the reason of which, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 5), is that we \"use money in token of taking possession of something,\" and again it is written (Eccles. 10:19): \"All things obey money.\" Therefore covetousness, which is desire for money, is a capital vice."

For in the first place it exceeds in retaining, and in this respect covetousness gives rise to \"insensibility to mercy,\" because, to wit, a man's heart is not softened by mercy to assist the needy with his riches [*See Question [30], Article [1]]. In the second place it belongs to covetousness to exceed in receiving, and in this respect covetousness may be considered in two ways. First as in the thought [affectu]. In this way it gives rise to \"restlessness,\" by hindering man with excessive anxiety and care, for \"a covetous man shall not be satisfied with money\" (Eccles. 5:9). Secondly, it may be considered in the execution  [effectu]. In this way the covetous man, in acquiring other people's goods, sometimes employs force, which pertains to \"violence,\" sometimes deceit, and then if he has recourse to words, it is \"falsehood,\" if it be mere words, \"perjury\" if he confirm his statement by oath; if he has recourse to deeds, and the deceit affects things, we have \"fraud\"; if persons, then we have \"treachery,\" as in the case of Judas, who betrayed Christ through covetousness."
