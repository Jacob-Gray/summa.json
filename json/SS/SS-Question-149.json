Now sobriety takes its name from \"measure,\" for a man is said to be sober because he observes the \"bria,\" i.e. the measure. Wherefore sobriety lays a special claim to that matter wherein /the observance of the measure is most deserving of praise. Such matter is the drinking of intoxicants, because the measured use thereof is most profitable, while immoderate excess therein is most harmful, since it hinders the use of reason even more than excessive eating. Hence it is written (Ecclus. 31:37,38): \"Sober drinking is health to soul and body; wine drunken with excess raiseth quarrels, and wrath and many ruins.\" For this reason sobriety is especially concerned with drink, not any kind of drink, but that which by reason of its volatility is liable to disturb the brain, such as wine and all intoxicants. Nevertheless, sobriety may be employed in a general sense so as to apply to any matter, as stated above (Question [123], Article [2]; Question [141], Article [2]) with regard to fortitude and temperance."

For old age gives a man a certain standing; wherefore honor and reverence are due to the old,  according to Lev. 19:32, \"Rise up before the hoary head, and honor the person of the aged man.\" Now the Apostle declares that old men especially should be exhorted to sobriety, according to Titus 2:2, \"That the aged man be sober.\" Therefore sobriety is most requisite in persons of standing."

                "I answer that, Virtue includes relationship to two things, to the contrary vices which it removes, and to the end to which it leads. Accordingly a particular virtue is more requisite in certain persons for two reasons. First, because they are more prone to the concupiscences which need to be restrained by virtue, and to the vices which are removed by virtue. In this respect, sobriety is most requisite in the young and in women, because concupiscence of pleasure thrives in the young on account of the heat of youth, while in women there is not sufficient strength of mind to resist concupiscence. Hence, according to Valerius Maximus [*Dict. Fact. Memor. ii, 1] among the ancient Romans women drank no wine. Secondly, sobriety is more requisite in certain persons, as being more necessary for the operations proper to them. Now immoderate use of wine is a notable obstacle to the use of reason: wherefore sobriety is specially prescribed to the old, in whom reason should be vigorous in instructing others: to bishops and all ministers of the Church, who should fulfil their spiritual duties with a devout mind; and to kings, who should rule their subjects with wisdom.",
