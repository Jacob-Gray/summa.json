Now the primary subjection of man to God is by faith, according to Heb. 11:6: \"He that cometh to God, must believe that He is.\" Hence faith is presupposed to the precepts of the Law: for which reason (Ex. 20:2) that which is of faith, is set down before the legal precepts, in the words, \"I am the Lord thy God, Who brought thee out of the land of Egypt,\" and, likewise (Dt. 6:4), the words, \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy [Vulg.: 'our'] God is one,\" precede the recording of the precepts.",
                "Since, however, faith contains many things subordinate to the faith whereby we believe that God is, which is the first and chief of all articles of faith, as stated above (Question [1], Articles [1],7), it follows that, if we presuppose faith in God, whereby man's mind is subjected to Him, it is possible for precepts to be given about other articles of faith. Thus Augustine expounding the words: \"This is My commandment\" (Jn. 15:12) says (Tract. lxxxiii in Joan.) that we have received many precepts of faith. In the Old Law, however, the secret things of faith were not to be set before the people, wherefore, presupposing their faith in one God, no other precepts of faith were given in the Old Law."
