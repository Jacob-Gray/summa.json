Because, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 6), there can be no mean and extremes in things which are essentially good. Now intellective knowledge is essentially good: because man's perfection would seem to consist in his intellect being reduced from potentiality to act, and this is done by the knowledge of truth. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that \"the good of the human soul is to be in accordance with reason,\" whose perfection consists in knowing the truth. Therefore the vice of curiosity cannot be about intellective knowledge."

Since, however, certain philosophers misuse the truth in order to assail the faith, the Apostle says (Col. 2:8): \"Beware lest any man cheat you by philosophy and vain deceit, according to the tradition of men . . . and not according to Christ\": and Dionysius says (Ep. vii ad Polycarp.) of certain philosophers that \"they make an unholy use of divine things against that which is divine, and by divine wisdom strive to destroy the worship of God.\""

Therefore curiosity about intellective sciences may be sinful."

                "I answer that, As stated above (Question [166], Article [2], ad 2) studiousness is directly, not about knowledge itself, but about the desire and study in the pursuit of knowledge. Now we must judge differently of the knowledge itself of truth, and of the desire and study in the pursuit of the knowledge of truth. For the knowledge of truth, strictly speaking, is good, but it may be evil accidentally, by reason of some result, either because one takes pride in knowing the truth, according to 1 Cor. 8:1, \"Knowledge puffeth up,\" or because one uses the knowledge of truth in order to sin.",
                "On the other hand, the desire or study in pursuing the knowledge of truth may be right or wrong. First, when one tends by his study to the knowledge of truth as having evil accidentally annexed to it, for instance those who study to know the truth that they may take pride in their knowledge. Hence Augustine says (De Morib. Eccl. 21): \"Some there are who forsaking virtue, and ignorant of what God is, and of the majesty of that nature which ever remains the same, imagine they are doing something great, if with surpassing curiosity and keenness they explore the whole mass of this body which we call the world. So great a pride is thus begotten, that one would think they dwelt in the very heavens about which they argue.\" In like manner, those who study to learn something in order to sin are engaged in a sinful study, according to the saying of Jer. 9:5, \"They have taught their tongue to speak lies, they have labored to commit iniquity.\"",
                "Secondly, there may be sin by reason of the appetite or study directed to the learning of truth being itself inordinate; and this in four ways. First, when a man is withdrawn by a less profitable study from a study that is an obligation incumbent on him; hence Jerome says [*Epist. xxi ad Damas]: \"We see priests forsaking the gospels and the prophets, reading stage-plays, and singing the love songs of pastoral idylls.\" Secondly, when a man studies to learn of one, by whom it is unlawful to be taught, as in the case of those who seek to know the future through the demons. This is superstitious curiosity, of which Augustine says (De Vera Relig. 4): \"Maybe, the philosophers were debarred from the faith by their sinful curiosity in seeking knowledge from the demons.\"",
                "Thirdly, when a man desires to know the truth about creatures, without referring his knowledge to its due end, namely, the knowledge of God. Hence Augustine says (De Vera Relig. 29) that \"in studying creatures, we must not be moved by empty and perishable curiosity; but we should ever mount towards immortal and abiding  things.\"",
                "Fourthly, when a man studies to know the truth above the capacity of his own intelligence, since by so doing men easily fall into error: wherefore it is written (Ecclus. 3:22): \"Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and search not into things above thy ability . . . and in many of His works be not curious,\" and further on (Ecclus. 3:26), \"For . . . the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath detained their minds in vanity.\""

For in the first place, both in man and in other animals, it is directed to the upkeep of the body, because by knowledge of this kind, man and other animals avoid what is harmful to them, and seek those things that are necessary for the body's sustenance. In the second place, it is directed in a manner special to man, to intellective knowledge, whether speculative or practical. Accordingly to employ study for the purpose of knowing sensible things may be sinful in two ways. First, when the sensitive knowledge is not directed to something useful, but turns man away from some useful consideration. Hence Augustine says (Confess. x, 35), \"I go no more to see a dog coursing a hare in the circus; but in the open country, if I happen to be passing, that coursing haply will distract me from some weighty thought, and draw me after it . . . and unless Thou, having made me see my weakness, didst speedily admonish me, I become foolishly dull.\" Secondly, when the knowledge of sensible things is directed to something harmful, as looking on a woman is directed to lust: even so the busy inquiry into other people's actions is directed to detraction. on the other hand, if one be ordinately intent on the knowledge of sensible things by reason of the necessity of sustaining nature, or for the sake of the study of intelligible truth, this studiousness about the knowledge of sensible things is virtuous."
