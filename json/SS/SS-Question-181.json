Accordingly, as it was stated above (Article [1], ad 3) that the moral virtues in one who directs them to the quiet of contemplation belong to the contemplative life, so the knowledge of prudence, which is of itself directed to the works of the moral virtues, belongs directly to the active life, provided we take prudence in its proper sense as the Philosopher speaks of it.",

It belongs to the active life, when a man conceives a truth inwardly, so as to be directed thereby in his outward action; but it belongs to the contemplative life when a man conceives an intelligible truth, in the consideration and love whereof he delights. Hence Augustine says (De Verb. Dom. Serm. civ, 1): \"Let them choose for themselves the better part,\" namely the contemplative life, \"let them be busy with the word, long for the sweetness of teaching, occupy themselves with salutary knowledge,\" thus stating clearly that teaching belongs to the contemplative life.",
                "The other object of teaching is on the part of the speech heard, and thus the object of teaching is the hearer. As to this object all doctrine belongs to the active life to which external actions pertain."

This is in keeping with the saying of Jeremias 31:34: \"They shall teach no more every man his neighbor . . . saying: Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least of them even to the greatest.\"",
                        "But as regards things pertaining to the \"dispensation of the mysteries of God,\" one angel teaches another by cleansing, enlightening, and perfecting him: and thus they have something of the active life so long as the world lasts, from the fact that they are occupied in administering to the creatures below them. This is signified by the fact that Jacob saw angels \"ascending\" the ladder---which refers to contemplation---and \"descending\" ---which refers to action. Nevertheless, as Gregory remarks (Moral. ii, 3), \"they do not wander abroad from the Divine vision, so as to be deprived of the joys of inward contemplation.\" Hence in them the active life does not differ from the contemplative life as it does in us for whom the works of the active life are a hindrance to contemplation.",
