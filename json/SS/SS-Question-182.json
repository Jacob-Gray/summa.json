                "I answer that, Nothing prevents certain things being more excellent in themselves, whereas they are surpassed by another in some respect. Accordingly we must reply that the contemplative life is simply more excellent than the active: and the Philosopher proves this by eight reasons (Ethic. x, 7,8). The first is, because the contemplative life becomes man according to that which is best in him, namely the intellect, and according to its proper objects, namely things intelligible; whereas the active life is occupied with externals. Hence Rachael, by whom the contemplative life is signified, is interpreted \"the vision of the principle,\" [*Or rather, 'One seeing the principle,' if derived from {rah} and {irzn}; Cf. Jerome, De Nom. Hebr.] whereas as Gregory says (Moral. vi, 37) the active life is signified by Lia who was blear-eyed. The second reason is because the contemplative life can be more continuous, although not as regards the highest degree of contemplation, as stated above (Question [180], Article [8], ad 2; Question [181], Article [4], ad 3), wherefore Mary, by whom the contemplative life is signified, is described as \"sitting\" all the time \"at the Lord's feet.\" Thirdly, because the contemplative life is more delightful than the active; wherefore Augustine says (De Verb. Dom. Serm. ciii) that \"Martha was troubled, but Mary feasted.\" Fourthly, because in the contemplative life man is more self-sufficient, since he needs fewer things for that purpose; wherefore it was said (Lk. 10:41): \"Martha, Martha, thou art careful and art troubled about many things.\" Fifthly, because the contemplative life is loved more for its own sake, while the active life is directed to something else. Hence it is written (Ps. 36:4): \"One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the  Lord all the days of my life, that I may see the delight of the Lord.\" Sixthly, because the contemplative life consists in leisure and rest, according to Ps. 45:11, \"Be still and see that I am God.\" Seventhly, because the contemplative life is according to Divine things, whereas active life is according to human things; wherefore Augustine says (De Verb. Dom. Serm. civ): \"'In the beginning was the Word': to Him was Mary hearkening: 'The Word was made flesh': Him was Martha serving.\" Eighthly, because the contemplative life is according to that which is most proper to man, namely his intellect; whereas in the works of the active life the lower powers also, which are common to us and brutes, have their part; wherefore (Ps. 35:7) after the words, \"Men and beasts Thou wilt preserve, O Lord,\" that which is special to man is added (Ps. 35:10): \"In Thy light we shall see light.\"",
                "Our Lord adds a ninth reason (Lk. 10:42) when He says: \"Mary hath chosen the best part, which shall not be taken away from her,\" which words Augustine (De Verb. Dom. Serm. ciii) expounds thus: \"Not---Thou hast chosen badly but---She has chosen better. Why better? Listen---because it shall not be taken away from her. But the burden of necessity shall at length be taken from thee: whereas the sweetness of truth is eternal.\"",
                "Yet in a restricted sense and in a particular case one should prefer the active life on account of the needs of the present life. Thus too the Philosopher says (Topic. iii, 2): \"It is better to be wise than to be rich, yet for one who is in need, it is better to be rich . . .\""

Now a man ought to offer to God, in the first place, his soul, according to Ecclus. 30:24, \"Have pity on thy own soul, pleasing God\"; in the second place, the souls of others, according to Apoc. 22:17, \"He that heareth, let him say: Come.\" And the more closely a man unites his own or another's soul to God, the more acceptable is his sacrifice to God; wherefore it is more acceptable to God that one apply one's own soul and the souls of others to contemplation than to action. Consequently the statement that \"no sacrifice is more acceptable to God than zeal for souls,\" does not mean that the merit of the active life is preferable to the merit  of the contemplative life, but that it is more meritorious to offer to God one's own soul and the souls of others, than any other external gifts."

                "I answer that, As stated above (FS, Question [114], Article [4]), the root of merit is charity; and, while, as stated above (Question [25], Article [1]), charity consists in the love of God and our neighbor, the love of God is by itself more meritorious than the love of our neighbor, as stated above (Question [27], Article [8]). Wherefore that which pertains more directly to the love of God is generically more meritorious than that which pertains directly to the love of our neighbor for God's sake. Now the contemplative life pertains directly and immediately to the love of God; for Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 19) that \"the  love of\" the Divine \"truth seeks a holy leisure,\" namely of the contemplative life, for it is that truth above all which the contemplative life seeks, as stated above (Question [181], Article [4], ad 2). On the other hand, the active life is more directly concerned with the love of our neighbor, because it is \"busy about much serving\" (Lk. 10:40). Wherefore the contemplative life is generically of greater merit than the active life. This is moreover asserted by Gregory (Hom. iii in Ezech.): \"The contemplative life surpasses in merit the active life, because the latter labors under the stress of present work,\" by reason of the necessity of assisting our neighbor, \"while the former with heartfelt relish has a foretaste of the coming rest,\" i.e. the contemplation of God.",
                "Nevertheless it may happen that one man merits more by the works of the active life than another by the works of the contemplative life. For instance through excess of Divine love a man may now and then suffer separation from the sweetness of Divine contemplation for the time being, that God's will may be done and for His glory's sake. Thus the Apostle says (Rm. 9:3): \"I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my brethren\"; which words Chrysostom expounds as follows (De Compunct. i, 7 [*Ad Demetr. de Compunct. Cordis.]): \"His mind was so steeped in the love of Christ that, although he desired above all to be with Christ, he despised even this, because thus he pleased Christ.\""

                "I answer that, The active life may be considered from two points of view. First, as regards the attention to and practice of external works: and thus it is evident that the active life hinders the contemplative, in so far as it is impossible for one to be busy with external action, and at the same time give oneself to Divine contemplation. Secondly, active life may be considered as quieting and directing the internal passions of the soul; and from this point of view the active life is a help to the contemplative, since the latter is hindered by the inordinateness of the internal passions. Hence Gregory says (Moral. vi, 37): \"Those who wish to hold the fortress of contemplation must first of all train in the camp of action. Thus after careful study they will learn whether they no longer wrong their neighbor, whether they bear with equanimity the wrongs their neighbors do to them, whether their soul is neither overcome with joy in the presence of temporal goods, nor cast down with too great a sorrow when those goods are withdrawn. In this way they will known when they withdraw within themselves, in order to explore spiritual things, whether they no longer carry with them the shadows of the things corporeal, or, if these follow them, whether they prudently drive them away.\" Hence the work of the active life conduces to the contemplative, by quelling the interior passions which give rise to the phantasms whereby contemplation is hindered.",
                "This suffices for the Replies to the Objections; for these arguments consider the occupation itself of external actions, and not the effect which is the quelling of the passions."

Hence Gregory says (Moral. vi, 37) that \"there be some so restless that when they are free from labor they labor all the more, because the more leisure they have for thought, the worse interior turmoil they have to bear.\" Others, on the contrary, have the mind naturally pure and restful, so that they are apt for contemplation, and if they were to apply themselves wholly to action, this would be detrimental to them. Wherefore Gregory says (Moral. vi, 37) that \"some are so slothful of mind that if they chance to have any hard work to do they give way at the very outset.\" Yet, as he adds further on, \"often . . . love stimulates slothful souls to work, and fear restrains souls that are disturbed in contemplation.\" Consequently those who are more adapted to the active life can prepare themselves for the contemplative by the practice of the active life; while none the less, those who are more adapted to the contemplative life can take upon themselves the works of the active life, so as to become yet more apt for contemplation."
