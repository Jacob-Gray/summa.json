Hence sloth implies a certain weariness of work, as appears from a gloss on Ps. 106:18, \"Their soul abhorred all manner of meat,\" and from the definition of some who say that sloth is a \"sluggishness of the mind which neglects to begin good.\"",

For sorrow is evil in itself when it is about that which is apparently evil but good in reality, even as, on the other hand, pleasure is evil if it is about that which seems to be good but is, in truth, evil. Since, then, spiritual good is a good in very truth, sorrow about spiritual good is evil in itself. And yet that sorrow also which is about a real evil, is evil in its effect, if it so oppresses man as to draw him away entirely from good deeds. Hence the Apostle (2 Cor. 2:7) did not wish those who repented to be \"swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.\"",

But it must be observed with regard to all sins that are mortal in respect of their genus, that they are not mortal, save when they attain to their perfection. Because the consummation of sin is in the consent of reason: for we are speaking now of human sins consisting in human acts, the principle of which is the reason. Wherefore if the sin be a mere beginning of sin in the sensuality alone, without attaining to the consent of reason, it is a venial sin on account of the imperfection of the act. Thus in the genus of adultery, the concupiscence that goes no further than the sensuality is a venial sin, whereas if it reach to the consent of reason, it is a mortal sin. So too, the movement of sloth is sometimes in the sensuality alone, by reason of the opposition of the flesh to the spirit, and then it is a venial sin; whereas sometimes it reaches to the reason, which consents in the dislike, horror and detestation of the Divine good, on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit. In this case it is evident that sloth is a mortal sin."

Now Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45) assigns six daughters to sloth, viz. \"malice, spite, faint-heartedness, despair, sluggishness in regard to the commandments, wandering of the mind after unlawful things.\" Now these do not seem in reality to arise from sloth. For \"spite\" is, seemingly the same as hatred, which arises from envy, as stated above (Question [34], Article [6]); \"malice\" is a genus which contains all vices, and, in like manner, a \"wandering\" of the mind after unlawful things is to be found in every vice;  \"sluggishness\" about the commandments seems to be the same as sloth, while \"faint-heartedness\" and \"despair\" may arise from any sin. Therefore sloth is not rightly accounted a capital sin."

                        "Reply to Objection 2: Gregory fittingly assigns the daughters of sloth. For since, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. viii, 5,6) \"no man can be a long time in company with what is painful and unpleasant,\" it follows that something arises from sorrow in two ways: first, that man shuns whatever causes sorrow; secondly, that he passes to other things that give him pleasure: thus those who find no joy in spiritual pleasures, have recourse to pleasures of the body, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. x, 6). Now in the avoidance of sorrow the order observed is that man at first flies from unpleasant objects, and secondly he even struggles against such things as cause sorrow. Now spiritual goods which are the object of the sorrow of sloth, are both end and means. Avoidance of the end is the result of \"despair,\" while avoidance of those goods which are the means to the end, in matters of difficulty which come under the counsels, is the effect of \"faint-heartedness,\" and in matters of common righteousness, is the effect of \"sluggishness about the commandments.\" The struggle against spiritual goods that cause sorrow is sometimes with men who lead others to spiritual goods, and this is called \"spite\"; and sometimes it extends to the spiritual goods themselves, when a man goes so far as to detest  them, and this is properly called \"malice.\" In so far as a man has recourse to eternal objects of pleasure, the daughter of sloth is called \"wandering after unlawful things.\" From this it is clear how to reply to the objections against each of the daughters: for \"malice\" does not denote here that which is generic to all vices, but must be understood as explained. Nor is \"spite\" taken as synonymous with hatred, but for a kind of indignation, as stated above: and the same applies to the others."

                        "Reply to Objection 3: This distinction between sorrow and sloth is also given by Cassian (De Instit. Caenob. x, 1). But Gregory more fittingly (Moral. xxxi, 45) calls sloth a kind of sorrow, because, as stated above (Article [2]), sorrow is not a distinct vice, in so far as a man shirks a distasteful and burdensome work, or sorrows on account of any other cause whatever, but only in so far as he is sorry on account of the Divine good, which sorrow belongs essentially to sloth; since sloth seeks undue rest in so far as it spurns the Divine good. Moreover the things which Isidore reckons to arise from sloth and sorrow, are reduced to those mentioned by Gregory: for \"bitterness\" which Isidore states to be the result of sorrow, is an effect of \"spite.\" \"Idleness\" and \"drowsiness\" are reduced to \"sluggishness about the precepts\": for some are idle and omit them altogether, while others are drowsy and fulfil them with negligence. All the other five which he reckons as effects of sloth, belong to the \"wandering of the mind after unlawful things.\" This tendency to wander, if it reside in the mind itself that is desirous of rushing after various things without rhyme or reason, is called \"uneasiness of the mind,\" but if it pertains to the imaginative power, it is called \"curiosity\"; if it affect the speech it is called \"loquacity\"; and in so far as it affects a body that changes place, it is called \"restlessness of the body,\" when, to wit, a man shows the unsteadiness of his mind, by the inordinate movements of members of his body; while if it causes the body to move from one place to another, it is called \"instability\"; or \"instability\" may denote changeableness of purpose."
