                "I answer that, As stated above (Question [16], Article [1]; FS, Question [99], Article [1]), a precept implies the notion of something due. Hence a thing is a matter of precept, in so far as it is something due. Now a thing is due in two ways, for its own sake, and for the sake of something else. In every affair, it is the end that is due for its own sake, because it has the character of a good for its own sake: while that which is directed to the end is due for the sake of something else: thus for a physician, it is due for its own sake, that he should heal, while it is due for the sake of something else that he should  give a medicine in order to heal. Now the end of the spiritual life is that man be united to God, and this union is effected by charity, while all things pertaining to the spiritual life are ordained to this union, as to their end. Hence the Apostle says (1 Tim. 1:5): \"The end of the commandment is charity from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.\" For all the virtues, about whose acts the precepts are given, are directed either to the freeing of the heart from the whirl of the passions---such are the virtues that regulate the passions---or at least to the possession of a good conscience---such are the virtues that regulate operations---or to the having of a right faith---such are those which pertain to the worship of God: and these three things are required of man that he may love God. For an impure heart is withdrawn from loving God, on account of the passion that inclines it to earthly things; an evil conscience gives man a horror for God's justice, through fear of His punishments; and an untrue faith draws man's affections to an untrue representation of God, and separates him from the truth of God. Now in every genus that which is for its own sake takes precedence of that which is for the sake of another, wherefore the greatest precept is that of charity, as stated in Mt. 22:39."

                "I answer that, This precept is differently worded in various places: for, as we said in the first objection, in Dt. 6 three points are mentioned: \"with thy whole heart,\" and \"with thy whole soul,\" and \"with thy whole strength.\" In Mt. 22 we find two of these mentioned, viz. \"with thy whole heart\" and \"with thy whole soul,\" while \"with thy whole strength\" is omitted, but \"with thy  whole mind\" is added. Yet in Mark 12 we find all four, viz. \"with thy whole heart,\" and \"with thy whole soul,\" and \"with thy whole mind,\" and \"with thy whole force\" which is the same as \"strength.\" Moreover, these four are indicated in Luke 10, where in place of \"strength\" or \"force\" we read \"with all thy might.\" [*St. Thomas is explaining the Latin text which reads \"ex tota fortitudine tua\" (Dt.), \"ex tota virtue tua\" (Mk.), and \"ex omnibus tuis\" (Lk.), although the Greek in all three cases has {ex holes tes ischyos}, which the Douay renders \"with thy whole strength.\"]",
                "Accordingly these four have to be explained, since the fact that one of them is omitted here or there is due to one implying another. We must therefore observe that love is an act of the will which is here denoted by the \"heart,\" because just as the bodily heart is the principle of all the movements of the body, so too the will, especially as regards the intention of the last end which is the object of charity, is the principle of all the movements of the soul. Now there are three principles of action that are moved by the will, namely, the intellect which is signified by \"the mind,\" the lower appetitive power, signified by \"the soul\"; and the exterior executive power signified by \"strength,\" \"force\" or \"might.\" Accordingly we are commanded to direct our whole intention to God, and this is signified by the words \"with thy whole heart\"; to submit our intellect to God, and this is expressed in the words \"with thy whole mind\"; to regulate our appetite according to God, in the words \"with thy whole soul\"; and to obey God in our external actions, and this is to love God with our whole \"strength,\" \"force\" or \"might.\"",
                "Chrysostom [*The quotation is from an anonymous author's unfinished work (Opus imperf. Hom. xlii, in Matth.) which is included in Chrysostom's works], on the other hand, takes \"heart\" and \"soul\" in the contrary sense; and Augustine (De Doctr. Christ. i, 22) refers \"heart\" to the thought, \"soul\" to the manner of life, and \"mind\" to the intellect. Again some explain \"with thy whole heart\" as denoting the intellect, \"with thy whole soul\" as signifying the will, \"with thy mind\" as pointing to the memory. And again, according to Gregory of Nyssa (De Hom. Opif. viii), \"heart\" signifies the vegetative soul, \"soul\" the sensitive, and \"mind\" the intellective soul, because our nourishment, sensation, and understanding ought all to be referred by us to God.",

Thus if the commander of an army order his soldiers to fight, his command will be perfectly obeyed by those who fight and conquer the foe, which is the commander's intention; yet it is fulfilled, albeit imperfectly, by those who fight without gaining the victory, provided they do nothing contrary to military discipline. Now God intends by this precept that man should be entirely united to Him, and this will be realized in heaven, when God will be \"all in all,\" according to 1 Cor. 15:28. Hence this precept will be observed fully and perfectly in heaven; yet it is fulfilled, though imperfectly, on the way. Nevertheless on the way one man will fulfil it more perfectly than another, and so much the more, as he approaches by some kind of likeness to the perfection of heaven."

The reason for loving is indicated in the word \"neighbor,\" because the reason why we ought to love others out of charity is because they are nigh to us, both as to the natural image of God, and as to the capacity for glory. Nor does it matter whether we say \"neighbor,\" or \"brother\" according to 1 Jn. 4:21, or \"friend,\" according to Lev. 19:18, because all these words express the same affinity.",

First, as regards the end, namely, that he should love his neighbor for God's sake, even as he loves himself for God's sake, so that his love for his neighbor is a \"holy\" love. Secondly, as regards the rule of love, namely, that a man should not give way to his neighbor in evil, but only in good things, even as he ought to gratify his will in good things alone, so that his love for his neighbor may be a \"righteous\" love. Thirdly, as regards the reason for loving, namely, that a man should love his neighbor, not for his own profit, or pleasure, but in the sense of wishing his neighbor well, even as he wishes himself well, so that his love for his neighbor may be a \"true\" love: since when a man loves his neighbor for his own profit or pleasure, he does not love his neighbor truly, but loves himself.",
