                        "There are four things whereby a man perfects his memory. First, when a man wishes to remember a thing, he should take some suitable yet somewhat unwonted illustration of it, since the  unwonted strikes us more, and so makes a greater and stronger impression on the mind; the mind; and this explains why we remember better what we saw when we were children. Now the reason for the necessity of finding these illustrations or images, is that simple and spiritual impressions easily slip from the mind, unless they be tied as it were to some corporeal image, because human knowledge has a greater hold on sensible objects. For this reason memory is assigned to the sensitive part of the soul. Secondly, whatever a man wishes to retain in his memory he must carefully consider and set in order, so that he may pass easily from one memory to another. Hence the Philosopher says (De Memor. et Remin. ii): \"Sometimes a place brings memories back to us: the reason being that we pass quickly from the one to the other.\" Thirdly, we must be anxious and earnest about the things we wish to remember, because the more a thing is impressed on the mind, the less it is liable to slip out of it. Wherefore Tully says in his Rhetoric [*Ad Herenn. de Arte Rhet. iii.] that \"anxiety preserves the figures of images entire.\" Fourthly, we should often reflect on the things we wish to remember. Hence the Philosopher says (De Memoria i) that \"reflection preserves memories,\" because as he remarks (De Memoria ii) \"custom is a second nature\": wherefore when we reflect on a thing frequently, we quickly call it to mind, through passing from one thing to another by a kind of natural order."

Post. i. 32]). But we need experience to discover what is true in the majority of cases: wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 1) that \"intellectual virtue is engendered and fostered by experience and time.\" Now experience is the result of many memories as stated in Metaph. i, 1, and therefore prudence requires the memory of many things.

The one is cognizant of universals, and this belongs to the understanding which is an intellectual virtue, whereby we know naturally not only speculative principles, but also practical universal principles, such as \"One should do evil to no man,\" as shown above (Question [47], Article [6]). The other understanding, as stated in Ethic. vi, 11, is cognizant of an extreme, i.e. of some primary singular and contingent practical matter, viz. the minor premiss, which must needs be singular in the syllogism of prudence, as stated above (Question [47], Articles [3],6). Now this primary singular is some singular end, as stated in the same place. Wherefore the understanding which is a part of prudence is a right estimate of some particular end."

                "I answer that, As stated above (Article [2], ad 1; Question [47], Article [3]) prudence is concerned with particular matters of action, and since such matters are of infinite variety, no one man can consider them all sufficiently; nor can this be done quickly, for it requires length of time. Hence in matters of prudence man stands in very great need of being taught by others, especially by old folk who have acquired a sane understanding of the ends in practical matters. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 11): \"It is right to pay no less attention to the undemonstrated assertions and opinions of such persons as are experienced, older than we are, and prudent, than to their demonstrations, for their experience gives them an insight into principles.\" Thus it is written (Prov. 3:5): \"Lean not on thy own prudence,\" and (Ecclus. 6:35): \"Stand in the multitude of the ancients\" (i.e. the old men), \"that are wise, and join thyself from thy heart to their wisdom.\" Now it is a mark of docility to be ready to be taught: and consequently docility is fittingly reckoned a part of prudence"

Thus to show signs of love to someone seems, considered in itself, to be a fitting way to arouse love in his heart, yet if pride or suspicion of flattery arise in his heart, it will no longer be a means  suitable to the end.
