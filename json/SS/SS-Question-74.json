Now of all one's external goods a friend takes the first place, since \"no man can live without friends,\" as the Philosopher declares (Ethic. viii, 1). Hence it is written (Ecclus. 6:15): \"Nothing can be compared to a faithful friend.\" Again, a man's good name whereof backbiting deprives him, is most necessary to him that he may be fitted for friendship. Therefore tale-bearing is a greater sin than backbiting or even reviling, because a friend is better than honor, and to be loved is better than to be honored, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. viii)."
