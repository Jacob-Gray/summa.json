Of these, two would seem to regard relations between equals, namely, \"friendship\" in the external conduct and \"concord\" internally; two regard our relations toward superiors, namely, \"piety\" to parents, and \"religion\" to God; while two regard our relations towards inferiors, namely, \"condescension,\" in so far as their good pleases us, and \"humanity,\" whereby we help them in their needs. For Isidore says (Etym. x) that a man is said to be \"humane, through having a feeling of love and pity towards men: this gives its name to humanity whereby we uphold one another.\" In this sense \"friendship\" is understood as directing our external conduct towards others, from which point of view the Philosopher treats of it in Ethic. iv, 6. \"Friendship\" may also be taken as regarding properly the affections, and as the Philosopher describes it in Ethic. viii and ix. In this sense three things pertain to friendship, namely, \"benevolence\" which is here called \"affection\"; \"concord,\" and \"beneficence\" which is here called \"humanity.\" These three, however, are omitted by Tully, because, as stated above, they have little of the nature of a due."

                "I answer that, Two points must be observed about the virtues annexed to a principal virtue. The first is that these virtues have something in common with the principal virtue; and the second is that in some respect they fall short of the perfection of that virtue. Accordingly since justice is of one man to another as stated above (Question [58], Article [2]), all the virtues that are directed to another person may by reason of this common aspect be annexed to justice. Now the essential character of justice consists in rendering to another his due according to equality, as stated above (Question [58], Article [11]). Wherefore in two ways may a virtue directed to another person fall short of the perfection of justice: first, by falling short of the aspect of equality; secondly, by falling short of the aspect of due. For certain virtues there are which render another his due, but are unable to render the equal due. In the first place, whatever man renders to God is due, yet it cannot be equal, as though man rendered to God as much as he owes Him, according to Ps. 115:12, \"What shall I render to the Lord for all the things that He hath rendered to me?\" In this respect \"religion\" is annexed  to justice since, according to Tully (De invent. ii, 53), it consists in offering service and ceremonial rites or worship to \"some superior nature that men call divine.\" Secondly, it is not possible to make to one's parents an equal return of what one owes to them, as the Philosopher declares (Ethic. viii, 14); and thus \"piety\" is annexed to justice, for thereby, as Tully says (De invent. ii, 53), a man \"renders service and constant deference to his kindred and the well-wishers of his country.\" Thirdly, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 3), man is unable to offer an equal meed for virtue, and thus \"observance\" is annexed to justice, consisting according to Tully (De invent. ii, 53) in the \"deference and honor rendered to those who excel in worth.\"",
                "A falling short of the just due may be considered in respect of a twofold due, moral or legal: wherefore the Philosopher (Ethic. viii, 13) assigns a corresponding twofold just. The legal due is that which one is bound to render by reason of a legal obligation; and this due is chiefly the concern of justice, which is the principal virtue. On the other hand, the moral due is that to which one is bound in respect of the rectitude of virtue: and since a due implies necessity, this kind of due has two degrees. For one due is so necessary that without it moral rectitude cannot be ensured: and this has more of the character of due. Moreover this due may be considered from the point of view of the debtor, and in this way it pertains to this kind of due that a man represent himself to others just as he is, both in word and deed. Wherefore to justice is annexed \"truth,\" whereby, as Tully says (De invent. ii, 53), present, past and future things are told without perversion. It may also be considered from the point of view of the person to whom it is due, by comparing the reward he receives with what he has done---sometimes in good things; and then annexed to justice we have \"gratitude\" which \"consists in recollecting the friendship and kindliness shown by others, and in desiring to pay them back,\" as Tully states (De invent. ii, 53)---and sometimes in evil things, and then to justice is annexed \"revenge,\" whereby, as Tully states (De invent. ii, 53), \"we resist force, injury or anything obscure* by taking vengeance or by self-defense.\" [*St. Thomas read 'obscurum,' and explains it as meaning 'derogatory,' infra Question [108], Article [2]. Cicero, however, wrote 'obfuturum,' i.e. 'hurtful.']",
                "There is another due that is necessary in the sense that it conduces to greater rectitude, although without it rectitude may be ensured. This due is the concern of \"liberality,\" \"affability\" or \"friendship,\" or the like, all of which Tully omits in the aforesaid enumeration because there is little of the nature of anything due in them."
