Accordingly, since man knows God through His creatures, this seems to pertain to \"knowledge,\" to which it belongs formally, rather than to \"wisdom,\" to which it belongs materially: and, conversely, when we judge of creatures according to Divine things, this pertains to \"wisdom\" rather than to \"knowledge.\""

Hence spiritual peace and the  resulting joy correspond directly to the gift of wisdom: but to the gift of knowledge there corresponds, in the first place, sorrow for past errors, and, in consequence, consolation, since, by his right judgment, man directs creatures to the Divine good. For this reason sorrow is set forth in this beatitude, as the merit, and the resulting consolation, as the reward; which is begun in this life, and is perfected in the life to come."
