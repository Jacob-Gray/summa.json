First we shall consider those which agree with religion in giving worship to God; secondly, we shall treat of those vices which are manifestly contrary to religion, through showing contempt of those things that pertain to the worship of God.

Therefore a twofold vice is opposed to a moral virtue. One by way of excess, the other by way of deficiency. Again, the mean of virtue may be exceeded, not only with regard to the circumstance called \"how much,\" but also with regard to other circumstances: so that, in certain virtues such as magnanimity and magnificence; vice exceeds the mean of virtue, not through tending to something greater than the virtue, but possibly to something less, and yet it goes beyond the mean of virtue, through doing something to whom it ought not, or when it ought not, and in like manner as regards other circumstances, as the Philosopher shows (Ethic. iv, 1,2,3).",

For the end of divine worship is in  the first place to give reverence to God, and in this respect the first species of this genus is \"idolatry,\" which unduly gives divine honor to a creature. The second end of religion is that man may be taught by God Whom he worships; and to this must be referred \"divinatory\" superstition, which consults the demons through compacts made with them, whether tacit or explicit. Thirdly, the end of divine worship is a certain direction of human acts according to the precepts of God the object of that worship: and to this must be referred the superstition of certain \"observances.\"",

Christ. ii, 20), where he says that \"anything invented by man for making and worshipping idols is superstitious,\" and this refers to the first species. Then he goes on to say, \"or any agreement or covenant made with the demons for the purpose of consultation and of compact by tokens,\" which refers to the second species; and a little further on he adds: \"To this kind belong all sorts of amulets and such like,\" and this refers to the third species."
