Now to act is not attributed to the nature as agent, but to the person, since \"acts belong to supposita and to singulars,\" according to the Philosopher (Metaph. i, 1). Nevertheless action is attributed to the nature as to that whereby the person or hypostasis acts. Hence, although the nature is not properly said to rule or serve, yet every hypostasis or person may be properly said to be ruling or serving in this or that nature. And in this way nothing prevents Christ being subject or servant to the Father in human nature."

                "I answer that, Whoever has a nature is competent to have what is proper to that nature. Now human nature from its beginning has a threefold subjection to God. The first regards the degree of goodness, inasmuch as the Divine Nature is the very essence of goodness as is clear from Dionysius (Div. Nom. i) while a created nature has a participation of the Divine goodness, being subject, so to say, to the rays of this goodness. Secondly, human nature is subject to God, as regards God's power, inasmuch as human nature, even as every creature, is subject to the operation of the Divine ordinance. Thirdly, human nature is especially subject to God through its proper act, inasmuch as by its own will it obeys His command. This triple subjection to God Christ professes of Himself. The first (Mt. 19:17): \"Why askest thou Me concerning good? One is good, God.\" And on this Jerome remarks: \"He who had called Him a good master, and had not confessed Him to be God or the Son of God, learns that no man, however holy, is good in comparison with God.\" And hereby He gave us to understand that He Himself, in His human nature, did not attain to the height of Divine goodness. And because \"in such things as are great, but not in bulk, to be great is the same as to be good,\" as Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 8), for this reason the Father is said to be greater than Christ in His human nature. The second subjection is attributed to Christ, inasmuch as all that befell Christ is believed to have happened by Divine appointment; hence Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. iv) that Christ \"is subject to the ordinance of God the Father.\" And this is the subjection of subservience, whereby \"every creature serves God\" (Judith 16:17), being subject to His ordinance, according to Wis. 16:24: \"The creature serving Thee the Creator.\" And in this way the Son of God (Phil. 2:7) is said to have taken \"the form of a servant.\" The third subjection He attributes to Himself, saying (Jn. 8:29): \"I do always the things that please Him.\" And this is the subjection to the Father, of obedience unto death. Hence it is written (Phil. 2:8) that he became \"obedient\" to the Father \"unto death.\""

                "I answer that, As was said above (Article [1], ad 2), to be master or servant is attributed to a person or hypostasis according to a nature. Hence when it is said that Christ is the master or servant of Himself, or that the Word of God is the Master of the Man Christ, this may be understood in two ways. First, so that this is understood to be said by reason of another hypostasis or person, as if there was the person of the Word of God ruling and the person of the man serving; and this is the heresy of Nestorius. Hence in the condemnation of Nestorius it is said in the Council of Ephesus (Part III, ch. i, anath. 6): \"If anyone say that the Word begotten of God the Father is the God or Lord of Christ, and does not rather confess the same to be at once God and man as the Word made flesh, according to the Scriptures, let him be anathema.\" And in this sense it is denied by Cyril and Damascene (Objection [1]); and in the same sense must it be denied that Christ is less than Himself or subject to Himself. Secondly, it may be understood of the diversity of natures in the one person or hypostasis. And thus we may say that in one of them, in which He agrees with the Father, He presides and rules together with the Father; and in the other nature, in which He agrees with us, He is subject and serves, and in this sense Augustine says that \"the Son is less than Himself.\"",
                "Yet it must be borne in mind that since this name \"Christ\" is the name of a Person, even as the name \"Son,\" those things can be predicated essentially and absolutely of Christ which belong to Him by reason of the Person, Which is eternal; and especially those relations which seem more properly to pertain to the Person or the hypostasis. But whatever pertains to Him in His human nature is rather to be attributed to Him with a qualification; so that we say that Christ is simply greatest, Lord, Ruler, whereas to be subject or servant or less is to be attributed to Him with the qualification, in His human nature."
