                        "Reply to Objection 2: As a gloss [*From St. Augustine, De Praed. Sanct. xv] says on Rm. 1:4, some understood that predestination to refer to the nature and not to the Person---that is to say, that on human nature was bestowed the grace of being united to the Son of God in unity of Person.",
                        "But in that case the phrase of the Apostle would be improper, for two reasons. First, for a general reason: for we do not speak of a person's nature, but of his person, as being predestinated: because to be predestinated is to be directed towards salvation, which belongs to a suppositum acting for the end of beatitude. Secondly, for a special reason. Because to be Son of God is not befitting to human nature; for this proposition is false: \"The human nature is the Son of God\": unless one were to force from it such an exposition as: \"Who was predestinated the Son of God in power\"---that is, \"It was predestinated that the Human nature should be united to the Son of God in the Person.\"",
                        "Hence we must attribute predestination to the Person of Christ: not, indeed, in Himself or as subsisting in the Divine Nature, but as subsisting in the human nature. Wherefore the Apostle, after saying, \"Who was made to Him of the seed of David according to the flesh,\" added, \"Who was predestinated the Son of  God in power\": so as to give us to understand that in respect of His being of the seed of David according to the flesh, He was predestinated the Son of God in power. For although it is natural to that Person, considered in Himself, to be the Son of God in power, yet this is not natural to Him, considered in the human nature, in respect of which this befits Him according to the grace of union."

                        "Reply to Objection 3: Origen commenting on Rm. 1:4 says that the true reading of this passage of the Apostle is: \"Who was destined to be the Son of God in power\"; so that no antecedence is implied. And so there would be no difficulty. Others refer the antecedence implied in the participle \"predestinated,\" not to the fact of being the Son of God, but to the manifestation thereof, according to the customary way of speaking in Holy Scripture, by which things are said to take place when they are made known; so that the sense would be---\"Christ was predestinated to be made known as the Son of God.\" But this is an improper signification of predestination. For a person is properly said to be predestinated by reason of his being directed to the end of beatitude: but the beatitude of Christ does not depend on our knowledge thereof.",
                        "It is therefore better to say that the antecedence implied in the participle \"predestinated\" is to be referred to the Person not in Himself, but by reason of the human nature: since, although that Person was the Son of God from eternity, it was not always true that one subsisting in human nature was the Son of God. Hence Augustine says (De Praedest. Sanct. xv): \"Jesus was predestinated, so that He Who according to the flesh was to be the son of David, should be nevertheless Son of God in power.\"",
                        "Moreover, it must be observed that, although the participle \"predestinated,\" just as this participle \"made,\" implies antecedence, yet there is a difference. For \"to be made\" belongs to the thing in itself: whereas \"to be predestinated\" belongs to someone as being in the apprehension of one who pre-ordains. Now that which is the subject of a form or nature in reality, can be apprehended either as under that form or absolutely. And since it cannot be said absolutely of the Person of Christ that He began to be the Son of God, yet this is becoming to Him as understood or apprehended to exist in human nature, because at one time it began to be true that one existing in human nature was the Son of God; therefore this proposition---\"Christ was predestinated the Son of God\"---is truer than this---\"Christ was made the Son of God.\""

Now, that man is God, and that God is man, is something done in time by God through the grace of union. Nor can it be said that God has not from eternity pre-ordained to do this in time: since it would follow that something would come anew into the Divine Mind. And we must needs admit that the union itself of natures in the Person of Christ falls under the eternal predestination of God. For this reason do we say that Christ was predestinated."

But because grace was not bestowed on the Son of God that He might be man, but rather on human nature, that it might be united to the Son of God; it is more proper to say that \"Christ, as Man, was predestinated to be the Son of God,\" than that, \"Christ, as Son of God, was predestinated to be Man.\""

Secondly, predestination may be considered as regards its temporal effect, which is some gratuitous gift of God. Therefore from both points of view we must say that predestination is ascribed to Christ by reason of His human nature alone: for human nature was not always united to the Word; and by grace bestowed an it was it united in Person to the Son of God. Consequently, by reason of human nature alone can predestination be attributed to Christ. Wherefore Augustine says (De Praedest. Sanct. xv): \"This human nature of ours was predestinated to be raised to so great, so lofty, so exalted a position, that it would be impossible to raise it higher.\" Now that is said to belong to anyone as man which belongs to him by reason of human nature.

                "Secondly, predestination may be considered on the part of that to which anyone is predestinated, and this is the term and effect of predestination. In this sense Christ's predestination is the exemplar of ours, and this in two ways. First, in respect of the good to which we are predestinated: for He was predestinated to be the natural Son of God, whereas we are predestinated to the adoption of sons, which is a participated likeness of natural sonship. Whence it is written (Rm. 8:29): \"Whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be made conformable to the image of His Son.\" Secondly, in respect of the manner of obtaining this good---that is, by grace. This is most manifest in Christ; because human nature in Him, without any antecedent merits, was united to the Son of God: and of the fulness of His grace we all have received, as it is written (Jn. 1:16)."
