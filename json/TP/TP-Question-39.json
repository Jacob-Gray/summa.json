Wherefore, though He needed not baptism for His own sake, yet carnal nature in others had need thereof.\" And, as Gregory Nazianzen says (Orat. xxxix) \"Christ was baptized that He might plunge the old Adam entirely in the water.\" Thirdly, He wished to be baptized, as Augustine says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cxxxvi), \"because He wished to do what He had commanded all to do.\" And this is what He means by saying: \"So it becometh us to fulfil all justice\" (Mt. 3:15).

[*From the supposititious Opus Imperfectum]), for this was Christ baptized, \"that He might confirm the preaching and the baptism of John, and that John might bear witness to Him.\" Now, men would not have had faith in John's testimony except after many had been baptized by him. Consequently it was not fitting that John should baptize Him before baptizing anyone else. In like manner, neither was it fitting that he should  baptize Him last. For as he (Chrysostom) says in the same passage: \"As the light of the sun does not wait for the setting of the morning star, but comes forth while the latter is still above the horizon, and by its brilliance dims its shining: so Christ did not wait till John had run his course, but appeared while he was yet teaching and baptizing.\""

                "I answer that, Christ was fittingly baptized in His thirtieth year. First, because Christ was baptized as though for the reason that He was about forthwith to begin to teach and preach: for which purpose perfect age is required, such as is the age of thirty. Thus we read (Gn. 41:46) that \"Joseph was thirty\" years old when he undertook the government of Egypt. In like manner we read (2 Kgs. 5:4) that \"David was thirty years old when he began to reign.\" Again, Ezechiel began to prophesy in \"his thirtieth year,\" as we read Ezech. 1:1.",
                "Secondly, because, as Chrysostom says (Hom. x in Matth.), \"the law was about to pass away after Christ's baptism: wherefore Christ came to be baptized at this age which admits of all sins; in order  that by His observing the law, no one might say that because He Himself could not fulfil it, He did away with it.\"",
                "Thirdly, because by Christ's being baptized at the perfect age, we are given to understand that baptism brings forth perfect men, according to Eph. 4:13: \"Until we all meet into the unity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ.\" Hence the very property of the number seems to point to this. For thirty is product of three and ten: and by the number three is implied faith in the Trinity, while ten signifies the fulfilment of the commandments of the Law: in which two things the perfection of Christian life consists."

And Chrysostom proves this (Hom. iv in Matth.; from the supposititious Opus Imperfectum) by saying that \"if the creature\"---namely, heaven---\"had been sundered he would not have said, 'were opened to Him,' since what is opened in a corporeal sense is open to all.\" Hence it is said expressly (Mk. 1:10) that Jesus \"forthwith coming up out of the water, saw the heavens opened\"; as though the opening of the heavens were to be considered as seen by Christ. Some, indeed, refer this to the corporeal vision, and say that such a brilliant light shone round about Christ when He was baptized, that the heavens seemed to be opened. It can also be referred to the imaginary vision, in which manner Ezechiel saw the heavens opened: since such a vision was formed in Christ's imagination by the Divine power and by His rational will, so as to signify that the entrance to heaven is opened to men through baptism. Lastly, it can be referred to intellectual vision: forasmuch as Christ, when He had sanctified baptism, saw that heaven was opened to men: nevertheless He had seen before that this would be accomplished."

Nor, again, was the Holy Ghost seen under the form of a dove, after the manner in which John saw the slain Lamb in the Apocalypse (5:6): \"For the latter vision took place in the spirit through spiritual images of bodies; whereas no one ever doubted that this dove was seen by the eyes of the body.\" Nor, again, did the Holy Ghost appear under the form of a dove in the sense in which it is said (1 Cor. 10:4): \"'Now, the rock was Christ': for the latter had already a created existence, and through the manner of its action was called by the name of Christ, whom it signified: whereas this dove came suddenly into existence, to fulfil the purpose of its signification, and afterwards ceased to exist, like the flame which appeared in the bush to Moses.\"",

                        "Reply to Objection 4: The Holy Ghost appeared over Christ at His baptism, under the form of a dove, for four reasons. First, on account of the disposition required in the one baptized---namely, that he approach in good faith: since! as it is written (Wis. 1:5): \"The holy spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful.\" For the dove is an animal of a simple character, void of cunning and deceit: whence it is said (Mt. 10:16): \"Be ye simple as doves.\"",
                        "Secondly, in order to designate the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, which are signified by the properties of the dove. For the dove dwells beside the running stream, in order that, on perceiving the hawk, it may plunge in and escape. This refers to the gift of wisdom, whereby the saints dwell beside the running waters of Holy Scripture, in order to escape the assaults of the devil. Again, the dove prefers the more choice seeds. This refers to the gift of knowledge, whereby the saints make choice of sound doctrines, with which they nourish themselves. Further, the dove feeds the brood of other birds. This refers to the gift of counsel, with which the saints, by teaching and example, feed men who have been the brood, i.e. imitators, of the devil. Again, the dove tears not with its beak. This refers to the gift of understanding, wherewith the saints do not rend sound doctrines, as heretics do. Again, the dove has no gall. This refers to the gift of piety, by reason of which the saints are free from unreasonable anger. Again, the dove builds its nest in the cleft of a rock. This refers to the gift of fortitude, wherewith the saints build their nest, i.e. take refuge and hope, in the death wounds of Christ, who is the Rock of strength. Lastly, the dove has a plaintive song. This refers to the gift of fear, wherewith the saints delight in bewailing sins.",
                        "Thirdly, the Holy Ghost appeared under the form of a dove on account of the proper effect of baptism, which is the remission of sins and reconciliation with God: for the dove is a gentle creature. Wherefore, as Chrysostom says, (Hom. xii in Matth.), \"at the Deluge this creature appeared bearing an olive branch, and publishing the tidings of the universal peace of the whole world: and now again the dove appears at the baptism, pointing to our Deliverer.\"",
                        "Fourthly, the Holy Ghost appeared over our Lord at His baptism in the form of a dove, in order to designate the common effect of baptism---namely, the building up of the unity of the Church. Hence it is written (Eph. 5:25-27): \"Christ delivered Himself up . . . that He might present . . . to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing . . . cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life.\" Therefore it was fitting that the Holy Ghost should appear at the baptism under the form of a dove, which is a creature both loving and gregarious. Wherefore also it is said of the Church (Cant 6:8): \"One is my dove.\"",
                        "But on the apostles the Holy Ghost descended under the form of fire, for two reasons. First, to show with what fervor their hearts were to be moved, so as to preach Christ everywhere, though  surrounded by opposition. And therefore He appeared as a fiery tongue. Hence Augustine says (Super Joan., Tract. vi): Our Lord \"manifests\" the Holy Ghost \"visibly in two ways\"---namely, \"by the dove corning upon the Lord when He was baptized; by fire, coming upon the disciples when they were met together . . . In the former case simplicity is shown, in the latter fervor . . . We learn, then, from the dove, that those who are sanctified by the Spirit should be without guile: and from the fire, that their simplicity should not be left to wax cold. Nor let it disturb anyone that the tongues were cloven . . . in the dove recognize unity.\"",
                        "Secondly, because, as Chrysostom says (Gregory, Hom. xxx in Ev.): \"Since sins had to be forgiven,\" which is effected in baptism, \"meekness was required\"; this is shown by the dove: \"but when we have obtained grace we must look forward to be judged\"; and this is signified by the fire."

Wherefore the very voice to which the Father gave utterance bore witness to the Sonship of the Word. And just as the form of the dove, in which the Holy Ghost was made manifest, is not the Nature of the Holy Ghost, nor is the form of man in which the Son Himself was manifested, the very Nature of the Son of God, so neither does the voice belong to the Nature of the Word or of the Father who spoke. Hence (Jn. 5:37) our Lord says: \"Neither have you heard His,\" i.e. the Father's, \"voice at any time, nor seen His shape.\" By which words, as Chrysostom says (Hom. xl in Joan.), \"He gradually leads them to the knowledge of the philosophical truth, and shows them that God has neither voice nor shape, but is above all such forms and utterances.\" And just as the whole Trinity made both the dove and the human nature assumed by Christ, so also they formed the voice: yet the Father alone as speaking is manifested by the voice, just as the Son alone assumed human nature, and the Holy Ghost alone is manifested in the dove, as Augustine [*Fulgentius, De Fide ad Petrum] makes evident."

Hence He says (Jn. 5:37): \"The Father Himself who sent Me, hath given testimony of Me.\" And specially at the time of baptism, by which men are born again into adopted sons of God; since God's sons by adoption are made to be like unto His natural Son, according to Rm. 8:29: \"Whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be made conformable to the image of His Son.\" Hence Hilary says (Super Matth. ii) that when Jesus was baptized, the Holy Ghost descended on Him, and the Father's voice was heard saying: \"'This is My beloved Son,' that we might know, from what was accomplished in Christ, that after being washed in the waters of baptism the Holy Ghost comes down upon us from on high, and that the Father's voice declares us to have become the adopted sons of God.\""

                "I answer that, As stated above (Article [5]), that which is accomplished in our baptism should be manifested in Christ's baptism, which was the exemplar of ours. Now the baptism which the faithful receive is hallowed by the invocation and the power of the Trinity; according to Mt. 28:19: \"Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\" Wherefore, as Jerome says on Mt. 3:16,17: \"The  mystery of the Trinity is shown forth in Christ's baptism. our Lord Himself is baptized in His human nature; the Holy Ghost descended in the shape of a dove: the Father's voice is heard bearing witness to the Son.\" Therefore it was becoming that in that baptism the Father should be manifested by a voice."
