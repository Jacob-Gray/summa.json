And therefore, in order to teach preachers that they ought not to be for ever before the public, our Lord withdrew Himself sometimes from the crowd. We are told of three reasons for His doing this. First, for the rest of the body: hence (Mk. 6:31) it is stated that our Lord said to His disciples: \"Come apart into a desert place, and rest a little. For there were many coming and going: and they had not so much as time to eat.\" But sometimes it was for the sake of prayer; thus it is written (Lk. 6:12): \"It came to pass in those days, that He went out into a mountain to pray; and He passed the  whole night in the prayer of God.\" On this Ambrose remarks that \"by His example He instructs us in the precepts of virtue.\" And sometimes He did so in order to teach us to avoid the favor of men. Wherefore Chrysostom, commenting on Mt. 5:1, Jesus, \"seeing the multitude, went up into a mountain,\" says: \"By sitting not in the city and in the market-place, but on a mountain and in a place of solitude, He taught us to do nothing for show, and to withdraw from the crowd, especially when we have to discourse of needful things.\""

                "I answer that, Christ's manner of life had to be in keeping  with the end of His Incarnation, by reason of which He came into the world. Now He came into the world, first, that He might publish the truth. thus He says Himself (Jn. 18:37): \"For this was I born, and for this came I into the world, that I should give testimony to the truth.\" Hence it was fitting not that He should hide Himself by leading a solitary life, but that He should appear openly and preach in public. Wherefore (Lk. 4:42,43) He says to those who wished to stay Him: \"To other cities also I must preach the kingdom of God: for therefore am I sent.\"",
                "Secondly, He came in order to free men from sin; according to 1 Tim. 1:15: \"Christ Jesus came into this world to save sinners.\" And hence, as Chrysostom says, \"although Christ might, while staying in the same place, have drawn all men to Himself, to hear His preaching, yet He did not do so; thus giving us the example to go about and seek those who perish, like the shepherd in his search of the lost sheep, and the physician in his attendance on the sick.\"",

And thus it was fitting that He should give men confidence in approaching Him by associating familiarly with them. Wherefore it is written (Mt. 9:10): \"It came to pass as He was sitting . . . in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with Jesus and His disciples.\" On which Jerome comments as follows: \"They had seen the publican who had been converted from a sinful to a better life: and consequently they did not despair of their own salvation.\""

Evang. ii, qu. 11) explains Mt. 11:19, \"Wisdom is justified by her children,\" saying that this is because the holy apostles \"understood that the kingdom of God does not consist in eating and drinking, but in suffering indigence with equanimity,\" for they are neither uplifted by affluence, nor distressed by want. Again (De Doctr. Christ. iii), he says that in all such things \"it is not making use of them, but the wantonness of the user, that is sinful.\" Now both these lives are lawful and praiseworthy---namely, that a man withdraw from the society of other men and observe abstinence; and that he associate with other men and live like them.

And for this did He proceed no further than Moses and Elias, lest His assumption of our flesh might seem incredible.\" The mystical meaning, as Gregory says (Hom. xvi in Evang.), is that by Christ's example the number \"forty\" is observed in His fast, because the power of the \"decalogue is fulfilled throughout the four books of the Holy Gospel: since ten multiplied by four amounts to forty.\" Or, because \"we live in this mortal body composed of the four elements, and by its lusts we transgress the commandments of the Lord, which are expressed in the decalogue.\" Or, according to Augustine (Questions. lxxxiii, qu. 81): \"To know the Creator and the creature is the entire teaching of wisdom. The Creator is the  Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Now the creature is partly invisible, as the soul, to which the number three may be ascribed, for we are commanded to love God in three ways, 'with our whole heart, our whole soul, and our whole mind'; and partly visible, as the body, to which the number four is applicable on account of its being subject to heat, moisture, cold, and dryness. Hence if we multiply ten, which may be referred to the entire moral code, by four, which number may be applied to the body, because it is the body that executes the law, the product is the number forty: in which,\" consequently, \"the time during which we sigh and grieve is shown forth.\" And yet there was no inconsistency in Christ's returning to the common manner of living, after fasting and (retiring into the) desert. For it is becoming to that kind of life, which we hold Christ to have embraced, wherein a man delivers to others the fruits of his contemplation, that he devote himself first of all to contemplation, and that he afterwards come down to the publicity of active life by associating with other men. Hence Bede says on Mk. 2:18: \"Christ fasted, that thou mightest not disobey the commandment; He ate with sinners, that thou mightest discern His sanctity and acknowledge His power.\""

But forasmuch as Christ was incapable of sin, He had not the same motive as Solomon for avoiding these things. Yet neither is every kind of beggary an occasion of theft and perjury, as Solomon seems to add (Prov. 30:8); but only that which is involuntary, in order to avoid which, a man is guilty of theft and perjury. But voluntary poverty is not open to this danger: and such was the poverty chosen by Christ."

This is what happened in regard to Christ: for it is written (Lk. 8:2,3) that  certain women followed Christ and \"ministered unto Him of their substance.\" For, as Jerome says on Mt. 27:55, \"It was a Jewish custom, nor was it thought wrong for women, following the ancient tradition of their nation, out of their private means to provide their instructors with food and clothing. But as this might give scandal to the heathens, Paul says that he gave it up\": thus it was possible for them to be fed out of a common fund, but not to possess wealth, without their duty of preaching being hindered by anxiety."

                "I answer that, It was fitting for Christ to lead a life of poverty in this world. First, because this was in keeping with the duty of preaching, for which purpose He says that He came (Mk. 1:38): \"Let us go into the neighboring towns and cities, that I may preach there also: for to this purpose am I come.\" Now in order that the preachers of God's word may be able to give all their time to preaching, they must be wholly free from care of worldly matters: which is impossible for those who are possessed of wealth. Wherefore the Lord Himself, when sending the apostles to preach, said to them (Mt. 10:9): \"Do not possess gold nor silver.\" And the apostles (Acts 6:2) say: \"It is not reasonable that we should leave the word of God and serve tables.\"",
                "Secondly, because just as He took upon Himself the death of the body in order to bestow spiritual life on us, so did He bear bodily poverty, in order to enrich us spiritually, according to 2 Cor. 8:9: \"You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: that . . . He became poor for our [Vulg.: 'your'] sakes that through His poverty we [Vulg.: 'you'] might be rich.\"",
                "Thirdly, lest if He were rich His preaching might be ascribed to cupidity. Wherefore Jerome says on Mt. 10:9, that if the disciples had been possessed of wealth, \"they had seemed to preach for gain, not for the salvation of mankind.\" And the same reason applies to Christ.",
                "Fourthly, that the more lowly He seemed by reason of His poverty, the greater might the power of His Godhead be shown to be. Hence in a sermon of the Council of Ephesus (P. iii, c. ix) we read: \"He chose all that was poor and despicable, all that was of small account and hidden from the majority, that we might recognize His Godhead to have transformed the terrestrial sphere. For this reason did He choose a poor maid for His Mother, a poorer birthplace; for this reason did He live in want. Learn this from the manger.\""

Now that Christ wrought miracles was a Divine work: hence He says (Jn. 5:17): \"My Father worketh until now; and I work.\"",
                        "Secondly, He excuses Himself on the ground that this precept does not forbid works which are needful for bodily health. Wherefore He says (Lk. 13:15): \"Doth not every one of you on the Sabbath-day loose his ox or his ass from the manger, and lead them to water?\" And farther on (Lk. 14:5): \"Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit, and will not immediately draw him out on the Sabbath-day?\" Now it is manifest that the miraculous works done by Christ related to health of body and soul.",

Now when Christ commanded the paralytic to carry his bed on the Sabbath-day, this pertained to the worship of God, i.e. to the praise of God's power. And thus it is clear that He did not break the Sabbath: although the Jews threw this false accusation in His face, saying (Jn. 9:16): \"This man is not of God, who keepeth not the Sabbath.\""
