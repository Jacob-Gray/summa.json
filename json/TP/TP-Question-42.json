                "I answer that, It was fitting that Christ's preaching, whether through Himself or through His apostles, should be directed at first to the Jews alone. First, in order to show that by His coming the promises were fulfilled which had been made to the Jews of old, and not to the Gentiles. Thus the Apostle says (Rm. 15:8): \"I say that Christ . . . was minister of the circumcision,\" i.e. the apostle and preacher of the Jews, \"for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.\"",
                "Secondly, in order to show that His coming was of God; because, as is written Rm. 13:1: \"Those things which are of God are well ordered [Vulg.: 'those that are, are ordained of God']\" [*See Scriptural Index on this passage]. Now the right order demanded that the doctrine of Christ should be made known first to the Jews, who, by believing in and worshiping one God, were nearer to God, and that it should be transmitted through them to the Gentiles: just as in the heavenly hierarchy the Divine enlightenment comes to the lower angels through the higher. Hence on Mt. 15:24, \"I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost in the house of Israel,\" Jerome  says: \"He does not mean by this that He was not sent to the Gentiles, but that He was sent to the Jews first.\" And so we read (Is. 66:19): \"I will send of them that shall be saved,\" i.e. of the Jews, \"to the Gentiles . . . and they shall declare My glory unto the Gentiles.\"",
                "Thirdly, in order to deprive the Jews of ground for quibbling. Hence on Mt. 10:5, \"Go ye not into the way of the Gentiles.\" Jerome says: \"It behooved Christ's coming to be announced to the Jews first, lest they should have a valid excuse, and say that they had rejected our Lord because He had sent His apostles to the Gentiles and Samaritans.\"",
                "Fourthly, because it was through the triumph of the cross that Christ merited power and lordship over the Gentiles. Hence it is written (Apoc. 2:26,28): \"He that shall overcome . . . I will give him power over the nations . . . as I also have received of My Father\"; and that because He became \"obedient unto the death of the cross, God hath exalted Him . . . that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow . . .\" and that \"every tongue should confess Him\" (Phil. 2:8-11). Consequently He did not wish His doctrine to be preached to the Gentiles before His Passion: it was after His Passion that He said to His disciples (Mt. 28:19): \"Going, teach ye all nations.\" For this reason it was that when, shortly before His Passion, certain Gentiles wished to see Jesus, He said: \"Unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground dieth, itself remaineth alone: but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit\" (Jn. 12:20-25); and as Augustine says, commenting on this passage: \"He called Himself the grain of wheat that must be mortified by the unbelief of the Jews, multiplied by the faith of the nations.\""

Hence Augustine says on Jn. 18:20: \"We must understand this, 'I have spoken openly to the world,' as though our  Lord had said, 'Many have heard Me' . . . and, again, it was not 'openly,' because they did not understand.\""

                "I answer that, Anyone's doctrine may be hidden in three ways. First, on the part of the intention of the teacher, who does not wish to make his doctrine known to many, but rather to hide it. And this may happen in two ways---sometimes through envy on the part of the teacher, who desires to excel in his knowledge, wherefore he is unwilling to communicate it to others. But this was not the case  with Christ, in whose person the following words are spoken (Wis. 7:13): \"Which I have learned without guile, and communicate without envy, and her riches I hide not.\" But sometimes this happens through the vileness of the things taught; thus Augustine says on Jn. 16:12: \"There are some things so bad that no sort of human modesty can bear them.\" Wherefore of heretical doctrine it is written (Prov. 9:17): \"Stolen waters are sweeter.\" Now, Christ's doctrine is \"not of error nor of uncleanness\" (1 Thess. 2:3). Wherefore our Lord says (Mk. 4:21): \"Doth a candle,\" i.e. true and pure doctrine, \"come in to be put under a bushel?\"",
                "Secondly, doctrine is hidden because it is put before few. And thus, again, did Christ teach nothing in secret: for He propounded His entire doctrine either to the whole crowd or to His disciples gathered together. Hence Augustine says on Jn. 18:20: \"How can it be said that He speaks in secret when He speaks before so many men? . . . especially if what He says to few He wishes through them to be made known to many?\"",
                "Thirdly, doctrine is hidden, as to the manner in which it is propounded. And thus Christ spoke certain things in secret to the crowds, by employing parables in teaching them spiritual mysteries which they were either unable or unworthy to grasp: and yet it was better for them to be instructed in the knowledge of spiritual things, albeit hidden under the garb of parables, than to be deprived of it altogether. Nevertheless our Lord expounded the open and unveiled truth of these parables to His disciples, so that they might hand it down to others worthy of it; according to 2 Tim. 2:2: \"The things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, the same command to faithful men, who shall be fit to teach others.\" This is foreshadowed, Num. 4, where the sons of Aaron are commanded to wrap up the sacred vessels that were to be carried by the Levites."

Especially do those pagans ask this question who dare not blame or blaspheme Christ, and who ascribe to Him most excellent, but merely human, wisdom. These say that the disciples made out the Master to be more than He really was when they said that He was the Son of God and the Word of God, by whom all things were made.\" And farther on he adds: \"It seems as though they were prepared to believe whatever He might have written of Himself, but not what others at their discretion published about Him.\" Therefore it seems that Christ should have Himself committed His doctrine to writing."

First, on account of His dignity: for the more excellent the teacher, the more excellent should be his manner of teaching. Consequently it was fitting that Christ, as the most excellent of teachers, should adopt that manner of teaching whereby His doctrine is imprinted on the hearts of His hearers; wherefore it is written (Mt. 7:29) that \"He was teaching them as one having power.\" And so it was that among the Gentiles, Pythagoras and Socrates, who were teachers of great excellence, were unwilling to write anything. For writings are ordained, as to an end, unto the imprinting of doctrine in the hearts of the hearers.",
                "Secondly, on account of the excellence of Christ's doctrine, which cannot be expressed in writing; according to Jn. 21:25: \"There are also many other things which Jesus did: which, if they were written everyone, the world itself, I think, would not be able to contain the books that should be written.\" Which Augustine explains by saying: \"We are not to believe that in respect of space the world could not contain them . . . but that by the capacity of the readers they could not be comprehended.\" And if Christ had committed His doctrine to writing, men would have had no deeper thought of His doctrine than that which appears on the surface of the writing.",

Moreover, it is by a Divine judgment that they err so far as to assert that these books were, as it were, entitled as letters to Peter and Paul, for that they found them in several places depicted in company with Christ. No wonder that the inventors were deceived by the painters: for as long as Christ lived in the mortal flesh with His disciples, Paul was no disciple of His.\""
