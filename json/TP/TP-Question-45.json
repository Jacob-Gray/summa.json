                "I answer that, Our Lord, after foretelling His Passion to His disciples, had exhorted them to follow the path of His sufferings (Mt. 16:21,24). Now in order that anyone go straight along a road, he must have some knowledge of the end: thus an archer will not shoot the arrow straight unless he first see the target. Hence Thomas said (Jn. 14:5): \"Lord, we know not whither Thou goest; and how can we know the way?\" Above all is this necessary when hard and rough is the road, heavy the going, but delightful the end. Now by His Passion Christ achieved glory, not only of His soul, not only of His soul, which He had from the first moment of His conception, but also of His body; according to Luke (24:26): \"Christ ought [Vulg.: 'ought not Christ'] to have suffered these things, and so to enter into His glory (?).\" To which glory He brings those who follow the footsteps of His Passion, according to Acts 14:21: \"Through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.\" Therefore it was fitting that He should show His disciples the glory of His clarity (which is to be transfigured), to which He will configure those who are His; according to Phil. 3:21: \"(Who) will reform the body of our lowness configured [Douay: 'made like'] to the body of His glory.\" Hence Bede says on Mk. 8:39: \"By His loving foresight He allowed them to taste for a short time the contemplation of eternal joy, so that they might bear persecution bravely.\""

                "I answer that, The clarity which Christ assumed in His transfiguration was the clarity of glory as to its essence, but not as to its mode of being. For the clarity of the glorified body is derived from that of the soul, as Augustine says (Ep. ad Diosc. cxviii). And in like manner the clarity of Christ's body in His transfiguration was derived from His God. head, as Damascene says (Orat. de Transfig.) and from the glory of His soul. That the glory of His soul did not overflow into His body from the first moment of Christ's conception was due to a certain Divine dispensation, that, as stated above (Question [14], Article [1], ad 2), He might fulfil the mysteries of our redemption in a passible body. This did not, however, deprive Christ of His power of outpouring the glory of His soul into His  body. And this He did, as to clarity, in His transfiguration, but otherwise than in a glorified body. For the clarity of the soul overflows into a glorified body, by way of a permanent quality affecting the body. Hence bodily refulgence is not miraculous in a glorified body. But in Christ's transfiguration clarity overflowed from His Godhead and from His soul into His body, not as an immanent quality affecting His very body, but rather after the manner of a transient passion, as when the air is lit up by the sun. Consequently the refulgence, which appeared in Christ's body then, was miraculous: just as was the fact of His walking on the waves of the sea. Hence Dionysius says (Ep. ad Cai. iv): \"Christ excelled man in doing that which is proper to man: this is shown in His supernatural conception of a virgin and in the unstable waters bearing the weight of material and earthly feet.\"",
                "Wherefore we must not say, as Hugh of St. Victor [*Innocent III, De Myst. Miss. iv] said, that Christ assumed the gift of clarity in the transfiguration, of agility in walking on the sea, and of subtlety in coming forth from the Virgin's closed womb: because the gifts are immanent qualities of a glorified body. On the contrary, whatever pertained to the gifts, that He had miraculously. The same is to be said, as to the soul, of the vision in which Paul saw God in a rapture, as we have stated in the SS, Question [175], Article [3], ad 2."

                        "Reply to Objection 2: This gloss is said to be taken from a book  entitled On the Marvels of Holy Scripture. It is not an authentic work, but is wrongly ascribed to St. Augustine; consequently we need not stand by it. For Jerome says on Mt. 17:3: \"Observe that when the Scribes and Pharisees asked for a sign from heaven, He refused to give one; whereas here in order to increase the apostles' faith, He gives a sign from heaven, Elias coming down thence, whither he had ascended, and Moses arising from the nether world.\" This is not to be understood as though the soul of Moses was reunited to his body, but that his soul appeared through some assumed body, just as the angels do. But Elias appeared in his own body, not that he was brought down from the empyrean heaven, but from some place on high whither he was taken up in the fiery chariot."

                        "Reply to Objection 3: As Chrysostom says on Mt. 17:3: \"Moses and Elias are brought forward for many reasons.\" And, first of all, \"because the multitude said He was Elias or Jeremias or one of the prophets, He brings the leaders of the prophets with Him; that hereby at least they might see the difference between the servants and their Lord.\" Another reason was \" . . . that Moses gave the Law . . . while Elias . . . was jealous for the glory of God.\" Therefore by appearing together with Christ, they show how falsely the Jews \"accused Him of transgressing the Law, and of blasphemously appropriating to Himself the glory of God.\" A third reason was \"to show that He has power of death and life, and that He is the judge of the dead and the living; by bringing with Him Moses who had died, and Elias who still lived.\" A fourth reason was because, as Luke says (9:31), \"they spoke\" with Him \"of His decease that He should accomplish in Jerusalem,\" i.e. of His Passion and death. Therefore, \"in order to strengthen the hearts of His disciples with a view to this,\" He sets before them those who had exposed themselves to death for God's sake: since Moses braved death in opposing Pharaoh, and Elias in opposing Achab. A fifth reason was that \"He wished His disciples to imitate the meekness of Moses and the zeal of Elias.\" Hilary adds a sixth reason---namely, in order to signify that He had been foretold by the Law, which Moses gave them, and by the prophets, of whom Elias was the principal."

                        "Reply to Objection 4: Lofty mysteries should not be immediately explained to everyone, but should be handed down through superiors to others in their proper turn. Consequently, as Chrysostom says (on Mt. 17:3), \"He took these three as being superior to the rest.\" For \"Peter excelled in the love\" he bore to Christ and in the power bestowed on him; John in the privilege of Christ's love for him on account of his virginity, and, again, on account of his being privileged to be an Evangelist; James on account of the privilege of martyrdom. Nevertheless He did not wish them to tell others what they had seen before His Resurrection; \"lest,\" as Jerome says on Mt. 17:19, \"such a wonderful thing should seem incredible to them; and lest, after hearing of so great glory, they should be scandalized at the Cross\" that followed; or, again, \"lest [the Cross] should be entirely hindered by the people\" [*Bede, Hom. xviii; cf. Catena Aurea]; and \"in order that they might then be witnesses of spiritual things when they should be filled with the  Holy Ghost\" [*Hilary, in Matth. xvii]."
