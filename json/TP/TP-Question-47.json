Accordingly it is written (Mk. 15:39): \"And the centurion who stood over against Him, seeing that crying out in this manner, He had given up the ghost, said: Indeed, this man was the Son of God.\" It was also a subject of wonder in Christ's death that He died sooner than the others who were tormented with the same suffering. Hence John says (19:32) that \"they broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with Him,\" that they might die more speedily; \"but after they were come to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.\" Mark also states (15:44) that \"Pilate wondered that He should be already dead.\" For as of His own will His bodily nature kept its vigor to the end, so likewise, when He willed, He suddenly succumbed to the injury inflicted."

In another way someone causes an effect indirectly---that is, by not preventing it when he can do so; just as one person is said to drench another by not closing the window through which the shower is entering: and in this way Christ was the cause of His own Passion and death. For He could have prevented His Passion and death. Firstly, by holding His enemies in check, so that they would not have been eager to slay Him, or would have been powerless to do so. Secondly, because His spirit had the power of preserving His fleshly nature from the infliction of any injury; and Christ's soul had this power, because it was united in unity of person with the Divine Word, as Augustine says (De Trin. iv). Therefore, since Christ's soul did not repel the injury inflicted on His body, but willed His corporeal nature to succumb to such injury, He is said to have laid down His life, or to have died voluntarily."

                        "Reply to Objection 1: Christ received a command from the Father to suffer. For it is written (Jn. 10:18): \"I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it up again: (and) this commandment have I received of My Father\"---namely, of laying down His life and of resuming it again. \"From which,\" as Chrysostom says (Hom. lix in Joan.), it is not to be understood \"that at first He awaited the command, and that He had need to be told, but He showed the proceeding to be a voluntary one, and destroyed suspicion of opposition\" to the Father. Yet because the Old Law was ended by Christ's death, according to His dying words, \"It is consummated\" (Jn. 19:30), it may be understood that by His suffering He fulfilled all the precepts of the Old Law. He fulfilled those of the moral order which are founded on the precepts of charity, inasmuch as He suffered both out of love of the Father, according to Jn. 14:31: \"That the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father hath given Me commandment, so do I: arise, let us go hence\"---namely, to the place of His Passion: and out of love of His neighbor, according to Gal. 2:20: \"He loved me, and delivered Himself up for me.\" Christ likewise by His Passion fulfilled the ceremonial precepts of the Law, which are chiefly ordained for sacrifices and oblations, in so far as all the ancient sacrifices were figures of that true sacrifice which the dying Christ offered  for us. Hence it is written (Col. 2:16,17): \"Let no man judge you in meat or drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is Christ's,\" for the reason that Christ is compared to them as a body is to a shadow. Christ also by His Passion fulfilled the judicial precepts of the Law, which are chiefly ordained for making compensation to them who have suffered wrong, since, as is written Ps. 68:5: He \"paid that which\" He \"took not away,\" suffering Himself to be fastened to a tree on account of the apple which man had plucked from the tree against God's command."

Secondly, it was suitable for reconciling man with God: hence it is written (Rm. 5:10): \"We are reconciled to God by the death of His Son,\" in so far as Christ's death was a most acceptable sacrifice to God, according to Eph. 5:2: \"He delivered Himself for us an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odor of sweetness.\" Now obedience is preferred to all sacrifices. according to 1 Kgs. 15:22: \"Obedience is better than sacrifices.\" Therefore it was fitting that the sacrifice of Christ's Passion and death should proceed from obedience. Thirdly, it was in keeping with His victory whereby He triumphed over death and its author; because a soldier cannot conquer unless he obey his captain.

                "I answer that, As observed above (Article [2]), Christ suffered voluntarily out of obedience to the Father. Hence in three respects God the Father did deliver up Christ to the Passion. In the first way, because by His eternal will He preordained Christ's Passion for the deliverance of the human race, according to the words of Isaias (53:6): \"The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquities of us all\"; and again (Is. 53:10): \"The Lord was pleased to bruise Him in infirmity.\" Secondly, inasmuch as, by the infusion of charity, He inspired Him with the will to suffer for us; hence we read in the same passage: \"He was offered because it was His own will\" (Is. 53:7). Thirdly, by not shielding Him from the Passion, but abandoning Him to His persecutors: thus we read (Mt. 27:46) that Christ, while hanging upon the cross, cried out: \"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\" because, to wit, He left Him to the power of His persecutors, as Augustine says (Ep. cxl)."

For they saw manifest signs of His Godhead; yet they perverted them out of hatred and envy of Christ; neither would they believe His words, whereby He avowed that He was the Son of God. Hence He Himself says of them (Jn. 15:22): \"If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.\" And afterwards He adds (Jn. 15:24): \"If I had not done among them the works that no other man hath done, they would not have sin.\" And so the expression employed by Job (21:14) can be accepted on their behalf: \"(Who) said to God: depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.\"",

For although some of them believed in Him, yet the multitude did not; and if they doubted sometimes whether He was the Christ, on account of the manifold signs and force of His teaching, as is stated Jn. 7:31,41, nevertheless they were deceived afterwards by their rulers, so that they did not believe Him to be the Son of God or the Christ. Hence Peter said to them: \"I know that you did it through ignorance, as did also your rulers\"---namely, because they were seduced by the rulers."

Consequently Christ's slayers are not excused of their  injustice. Nevertheless, whoever slays a man not only does a wrong to the one slain, but likewise to God and to the State; just as he who kills himself, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. v). Hence it was that David condemned to death the man who \"did not fear to lay hands upon the Lord's anointed,\" even though he (Saul) had requested it, as related 2 Kgs. 1:5-14."

                "I answer that, As stated above (Article [5]), the rulers of the Jews knew that He was the Christ: and if there was any ignorance in them, it was affected ignorance, which could not excuse them. Therefore their sin was the most grievous, both on account of the kind of sin, as well as from the malice of their will. The Jews also of the common order sinned most grievously as to the kind of their sin: yet in one respect their crime was lessened by reason of their ignorance. Hence Bede, commenting on Lk. 23:34, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,\" says: \"He prays for them who know not what they are doing, as having the zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.\" But the sin of the Gentiles, by whose hands He was crucified, was much more excusable, since they had no knowledge of the Law."
