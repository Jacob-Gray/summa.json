                "I answer that, Christ's Passion is the proper cause of the forgiveness of sins in three ways. First of all, by way of exciting our charity, because, as the Apostle says (Rm. 5:8): \"God commendeth His charity towards us: because when as yet we were sinners, according to the time, Christ died for us.\" But it is by  charity that we procure pardon of our sins, according to Lk. 7:47: \"Many sins are forgiven her because she hath loved much.\" Secondly, Christ's Passion causes forgiveness of sins by way of redemption. For since He is our head, then, by the Passion which He endured from love and obedience, He delivered us as His members from our sins, as by the price of His Passion: in the same way as if a man by the good industry of his hands were to redeem himself from a sin committed with his feet. For, just as the natural body is one though made up of diverse members, so the whole Church, Christ's mystic body, is reckoned as one person with its head, which is Christ. Thirdly, by way of efficiency, inasmuch as Christ's flesh, wherein He endured the Passion, is the instrument of the Godhead, so that His sufferings and actions operate with Divine power for expelling sin."

Another point is on God's part, whom man had offended by sinning, and who with justice left man under the devil's power. The third is on the devil's part, who out of his most wicked will hindered man from securing his salvation.",

As to the second, it must be said that Christ's Passion freed us from the devil's power, inasmuch as it reconciled us with God, as shall be shown later (Article [4]). But as to the third, Christ's Passion delivered us from the devil, inasmuch as in Christ's Passion he exceeded the limit of power assigned him by God, by conspiring to bring about Christ's death, Who, being sinless, did not deserve to die. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, cap. xiv): \"The devil was vanquished by  Christ's justice: because, while discovering in Him nothing deserving of death, nevertheless he slew Him. And it is certainly just that the debtors whom he held captive should be set at liberty since they believed in Him whom the devil slew, though He was no debtor.\""

Now we are likened unto Him sacramentally in Baptism, according to Rm. 6:4: \"For we are buried together with Him by baptism into death.\" Hence no punishment of satisfaction is imposed upon men at their baptism, since they are fully delivered by Christ's satisfaction. But because, as it is written (1 Pt. 3:18), \"Christ died\" but \"once for our sins,\" therefore a man cannot a second time be likened unto Christ's death by the sacrament of Baptism. Hence it is necessary that those who sin after Baptism be likened unto Christ suffering by some form of punishment or suffering which they endure in their own person; yet, by the co-operation of Christ's satisfaction, much lighter penalty suffices than one that is proportionate to the sin."

The first is common to the whole race, for it is our first parents' sin, and by that sin heaven's entrance is closed to man. Hence we read in Gn. 3:24 that after our first parents' sin God \"placed . . . cherubim and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.\" The other is the personal sin of each one of us, committed by our personal act.",

For eminence of rank belongs to God alone, just as knowledge of truth, according to Ps. 112:4: \"The Lord is high above all nations, and His glory above the heavens.\" But Christ as man had the knowledge of all truth, not on account of any preceding merit, but from the very union of God and man, according to Jn. 1:14: \"We saw His glory . . . as it were of the only-Begotten of the Father, full of grace and of truth.\" Therefore neither had He exaltation from the merit of the Passion but from the union alone."

But it was not beseeming for the glory of His soul to be postponed, since the soul was united immediately with the Word; hence it was beseeming that its glory should be filled by the Word Himself.

                "I answer that, Merit implies a certain equality of justice: hence the Apostle says (Rm. 4:4): \"Now to him that worketh, the reward is reckoned according to debt.\" But when anyone by reason of his unjust will ascribes to himself something beyond his due, it is only just that he be deprived of something else which is his due; thus, \"when a man steals a sheep he shall pay back four\" (Ex. 22:1). And he is said to deserve it, inasmuch as his unjust will is chastised thereby. So likewise when any man through his just will has stripped himself of what he ought to have, he deserves that something further be granted to him as the reward of his just will. And hence it is written (Lk. 14:11): \"He that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\"",
                "Now in His Passion Christ humbled Himself beneath His dignity in four respects. In the first place as to His Passion and death, to which He was not bound; secondly, as to the place, since His body was laid in a sepulchre and His soul in hell; thirdly, as to the shame and mockeries He endured; fourthly, as to His being delivered up to man's power, as He Himself said to Pilate (Jn. 19:11): \"Thou shouldst not have any power against Me, unless it were given thee from above.\" And, consequently, He merited a four-fold exaltation from His Passion. First of all, as to His glorious Resurrection: hence it is written (Ps. 138:1): \"Thou hast known my sitting down\"---that is, the lowliness of My Passion---\"and My rising up.\" Secondly, as to His ascension into heaven: hence it is written (Eph. 4:9): \"Now that He ascended, what is it, but because He also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended above all the heavens.\" Thirdly, as to the sitting on the right hand of the Father and the showing forth of His Godhead, according to Is. 52:13: \"He shall be exalted and extolled, and shall be exceeding high: as many have been astonished at him, so shall His visage be inglorious among men.\" Moreover (Phil. 2:8) it is written: \"He humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross: for which cause also God hath exalted Him, and hath given Him a name which is above all names\"---that is to say, so that He shall be hailed as God by all; and all shall pay Him homage as God. And this is expressed in what follows: \"That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth.\" Fourthly, as to His judiciary power: for it is written (Job 36:17): \"Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked cause and judgment Thou shalt recover.\""
