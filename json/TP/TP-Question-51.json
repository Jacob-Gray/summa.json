Hence we read (Mk. 15:44,45), that Pilate by diligent inquiry assured himself of Christ's death before granting leave for His burial. Secondly, because by Christ's rising from the grave, to them who are in the grave, hope is given of rising again through Him, according to Jn. 5:25,28: \"All that are in their graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God . . . and they that hear shall live.\" Thirdly, as an example to them who dying spiritually to their sins are hidden away \"from the disturbance of men\" (Ps. 30:21). Hence it is said (Col. 3:3): \"You are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.\" Wherefore the baptized likewise who through Christ's death die to sins, are as it were buried with Christ by immersion, according to Rm. 6:4: \"We are buried together with Christ by baptism into death.\""

Catena Aurea in Joan. xix]. Accordingly it is said in De Doctr. Christ. iii that \"in all such things, it is not the use thereof, but the luxury of the user that is at fault\"; and, farther on: \"what in other persons is frequently criminal, in a divine or prophetic person is a sign of something great.\" For myrrh and aloes by their bitterness denote penance, by which man keeps Christ within himself without the corruption of sin; while the odor of the ointments expresses good report."

But for this \"was our Lord buried in the grave of a stranger,\" as Augustine says in a sermon (ccxlviii), \"because He died for the salvation of others; and a sepulchre is the abode of death.\" Also the extent of the poverty endured for us can be thereby estimated: since He who while living had no home, after death was laid to rest in another's tomb, and being naked was clothed by Joseph. But He is laid in a \"new\" sepulchre, as Jerome observes on Mt. 27:60, \"lest after the resurrection it might be pretended that someone else had risen, while the other corpses remained. The new sepulchre can also denote Mary's virginal womb.\" And furthermore it may be understood that all of us are renewed by Christ's burial; death and corruption being destroyed. Moreover, He was buried in a monument \"hewn out of a rock,\" as Jerome says on Mt. 27:64, \"lest, if it had been constructed of many stones, they might say that He was stolen away by digging away the foundations of the tomb.\" Hence the \"great stone\" which was set shows that \"the tomb could not be opened except by the help of many hands. Again, if He had been buried in the earth, they might have said: They dug up the soil and stole Him away,\" as Augustine observes [*Cf. Catena Aurea]. Hilary (Comment. in Matth. cap. xxxiii) gives the mystical interpretation, saying that \"by the teaching of the apostles, Christ is borne into the stony heart of the gentile; for it is hewn out by the process of teaching, unpolished and new, untenanted and open to the entrance of the fear of God. And since naught besides Him must enter into our hearts, a great stone is rolled against the door.\" Furthermore, as Origen says (Tract. xxxv in Matth.): \"It was not written by hazard: 'Joseph wrapped Christ's body in a clean winding-sheet, and placed it in a new monument,'\" and that \"'he rolled a great stone,' because all things around the body of Jesus are clean, and new, and exceeding great.\""

Yet of His own will He endured death for our salvation, for the reasons alleged above (Question [51], Article [1]).

Hence it is on His behalf that it is written (Ps. 19:10): \"What profit is there in my blood, whilst I go down to corruption?\" as if He were to say: \"If My body corrupt, the profit of the blood shed will be lost.\""

But as was said above (Question [50], Article [1], ad 2), Christ's death ought not to come from weakness of nature, lest it might not be believed to be voluntary: and therefore He willed to die, not from sickness, but from suffering inflicted on Him, to which He gave Himself up willingly. And therefore, lest His death might be ascribed to infirmity of nature, Christ did not wish His body to putrefy in any way or dissolve no matter how; but for the manifestation of His Divine power He willed that His body should continue incorrupt. Hence Chrysostom says (Cont. Jud. et Gent. quod 'Christus sit Deus') that \"with other men, especially with such as have wrought strenuously, their deeds shine forth in their lifetime; but as soon as they die, their deeds go with them. But it is quite the contrary with Christ: because previous to the cross all is sadness and weakness, but as soon as He is crucified, everything comes to light, in order that you may learn it was not an ordinary man that was crucified.\""

Evang. iii): \"Some men, ignorant of Scriptural language, wished to compute as night those three hours, from the sixth to the ninth hour, during which the sun was darkened, and as day those other three hours during which it was restored to the earth, that is, from the ninth hour  until its setting: for the coming night of the Sabbath follows, and if this be reckoned with its day, there will be already two nights and two days. Now after the Sabbath there follows the night of the first day of the Sabbath, that is, of the dawning Sunday, on which the Lord rose. Even so, the reckoning of the three days and three nights will not stand. It remains then to find the solution in the customary usage of speech of the Scriptures, whereby the whole is understood from the part\": so that we are able to take a day and a night as one natural day. And so the first day is computed from its ending, during which Christ died and was buried on the Friday; while the second. day is an entire day with twenty-four hours of night and day; while the night following belongs to the third day. \"For as the primitive days were computed from light to night on account of man's future fall, so these days are computed from the darkness to the daylight on account of man's restoration\" (De Trin. iv)."

Hence it is said of the women that \"when it was yet dark\" they came \"to the sepulchre\" (Jn. 20:1). Therefore, in consequence of this darkness, Gregory says (Hom. xxi) that Christ rose in the middle of the night, not that night is divided into two equal parts, but during the night itself: for the expression \"early\" can be taken as partly night and partly day, from its fittingness with both."
