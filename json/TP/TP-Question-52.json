                "I answer that It was fitting for Christ to descend into hell. First of all, because He came to bear our penalty in order to free us from penalty, according to Is. 53:4: \"Surely He hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows.\" But through sin man had incurred not only the death of the body, but also descent into hell. Consequently since it was fitting for Christ to die in order to deliver us from death, so it was fitting for Him to descend into hell in order to deliver us also from going down into hell. Hence it is written (Osee 13:14): \"O death, I will be thy death; O hell, I will be thy bite.\" Secondly, because it was fitting when the devil was overthrown by the Passion that Christ should deliver the captives detained in hell, according to Zach. 9:11: \"Thou also by the blood of Thy Testament hast sent forth Thy prisoners out of the pit.\" And it is written (Col. 2:15): \"Despoiling the principalities and powers, He hath exposed them confidently.\" Thirdly, that as He showed forth His power on earth by living and dying, so also He might manifest it in hell, by visiting it and enlightening it. Accordingly it is written (Ps. 23:7): \"Lift up your gates, O ye princes,\" which the gloss thus interprets: \"that is---Ye princes of hell, take away your power, whereby hitherto you held men fast in hell\"; and so \"at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,\" not only \"of them that are in heaven,\" but likewise \"of them that are in hell,\" as is said in Phil. 2:10."

Yet Christ bestowed something upon them as to their attaining glory: and in consequence He dispelled the suffering which they endured through their glory being delayed: still they had great joy from the very hope thereof, according to Jn. 8:56: \"Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day.\" And therefore he adds: \"I fail to see that He ever departed, according to the beatific presence of His Godhead,\" that is, inasmuch as even before Christ's coming they were happy in hope, although not yet fully happy in fact."

But through Christ's Passion the human race was delivered not only from sin, but also from the debt of its penalty, as stated above (Question [49], Articles [1],3). Now men were held fast by the debt of punishment in two ways: first of all for actual sin which each had committed personally: secondly, for the sin of the whole human race, which each one in his origin contracts from our first parent, as stated in Rm. 5 of which sin the penalty is the death of the body as well as exclusion from glory, as is evident from Gn. 2 and 3: because God cast out man from paradise after sin, having beforehand threatened him with death should he sin. Consequently, when Christ descended into hell, by the power of His Passion He delivered the saints from the penalty whereby they were excluded from the life of glory, so as to be unable to see God in His Essence, wherein man's beatitude lies, as stated in the FS, Question [3], Article [8]. But the holy Fathers were detained in hell for the reason, that, owing to our first parent's sin, the approach to the life of glory was not opened. And so when Christ descended into hell He delivered the holy Fathers from thence. And this is what is written Zach. 9:11: \"Thou also by the blood of Thy testament hast sent forth Thy prisoners out of the pit, wherein is no water.\" And (Col. 2:15) it is written that \"despoiling the principalities and powers,\" i.e. \"of hell, by taking out Isaac and Jacob, and the other just souls,\" \"He led them,\" i.e. \"He brought them far from this kingdom of darkness into  heaven,\" as the gloss explains."
