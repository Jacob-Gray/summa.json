            "body": [
                "I answer that, Some have fallen into various errors about the matter of this sacrament. Some, known as the Artotyrytae, as Augustine says (De Haeres. xxviii), \"offer bread and cheese in this sacrament, contending that oblations were celebrated by men in the first ages, from fruits of the earth and sheep.\" Others, called Cataphrygae and Pepuziani, \"are reputed to have made their Eucharistic bread with infants' blood drawn from tiny punctures over the entire body, and mixed with flour.\" Others, styled Aquarii, under guise of sobriety, offer nothing but water in this sacrament.",
                "Now all these and similar errors are excluded by the fact that Christ instituted this sacrament under the species of bread and wine, as is evident from Mt. 26. Consequently, bread and wine are the proper matter of this sacrament. And the reasonableness of this is seen first, in the use of this sacrament, which is eating: for, as water is used in the sacrament of Baptism for the purpose of spiritual cleansing, since bodily cleansing is commonly done with water; so bread and wine, wherewith men are commonly fed, are employed in this sacrament for the use of spiritual eating.",
                "Secondly, in relation to Christ's Passion, in which the blood was separated from the body. And therefore in this sacrament, which is the memorial of our Lord's Passion, the bread is received apart as the sacrament of the body, and the wine as the sacrament of the blood.",
                "Thirdly, as to the effect, considered in each of the partakers. For, as Ambrose (Mag. Sent. iv, D, xi) says on 1 Cor. 11:20, this sacrament \"avails for the defense of soul and body\"; and therefore \"Christ's body is offered\" under the species of bread \"for the health of the body, and the blood\" under the species of wine \"for the health of the soul,\" according to Lev. 17:14: \"The life of the animal [Vulg.: 'of all flesh'] is in the blood.\"",
                "Fourthly, as to the effect with regard to the whole Church, which is made up of many believers, just \"as bread is composed of many grains, and wine flows from many grapes,\" as the gloss observes on 1 Cor. 10:17: \"We being many are . . . one body,\" etc."

It is necessary that the bread be wheaten, without which the sacrament is not valid, as stated above (Article [3]). It is not, however, necessary for the sacrament that the bread be unleavened  or leavened, since it can be celebrated in either.",
                "But it is suitable that every priest observe the rite of his Church in the celebration of the sacrament. Now in this matter there are various customs of the Churches: for, Gregory says: \"The Roman Church offers unleavened bread, because our Lord took flesh without union of sexes: but the Greek Churches offer leavened bread, because the Word of the Father was clothed with flesh; as leaven is mixed with the flour.\" Hence, as a priest sins by celebrating with fermented bread in the Latin Church, so a Greek priest celebrating with unfermented bread in a church of the Greeks would also sin, as perverting the rite of his Church. Nevertheless the custom of celebrating with unleavened bread is more reasonable. First, on account of Christ's institution: for He instituted this sacrament \"on the first day of the Azymes\" (Mt. 26:17; Mk. 14:12; Lk. 22:7), on which day there ought to be nothing fermented in the houses of the Jews, as is stated in Ex. 12:15,19. Secondly, because bread is properly the sacrament of Christ's body, which was conceived without corruption, rather than of His Godhead, as will be seen later (Question [76], Article [1], ad 1). Thirdly, because this is more in keeping with the sincerity of the faithful, which is required in the use of this sacrament, according to 1 Cor. 5:7: \"Christ our Pasch is sacrificed: therefore let us feast . . . with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.\"",
                "However, this custom of the Greeks is not unreasonable both on account of its signification, to which Gregory refers, and in detestation of the heresy of the Nazarenes, who mixed up legal observances with the Gospel."

Because, as Ambrose says in De Officiis (De Mysteriis ix): \"Before the blessing it is another species that is named, after the blessing the Body is signified; otherwise it would not be adored with adoration of latria.\" And therefore others have said that as the wine is changed into blood, so the water is changed into the water which flowed from Christ's side.

Now, this could not be done unless so little water was used that it would be changed into wine. Consequently, it is always safer to add little water, especially if the wine be weak, because the sacrament could not be celebrated if there were such addition of water as to destroy the species of the wine. Hence Pope Julius I reprehends some who \"keep throughout the year a linen cloth steeped in must, and at the time of sacrifice wash a part of it with water, and so make the offering.\""
