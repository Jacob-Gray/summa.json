                        "Reply to Objection 1: There are many opinions on this matter. Some have said that Christ, Who had power of excellence in the sacraments, performed this sacrament without using any form of words, and that afterwards He pronounced the words under which others were to consecrate thereafter. And the words of Pope Innocent III seem to convey the same sense (De Sacr. Alt. Myst. iv), where he says: \"In good sooth it can be said that Christ accomplished this sacrament by His Divine power, and subsequently expressed the form under which those who came after were to consecrate.\" But in opposition to this view are the words of the Gospel in which it is said that Christ \"blessed,\" and this blessing was effected by certain words. Accordingly those words of Innocent are to be considered as expressing an opinion, rather than determining the point.",
                        "Others, again, have said that the blessing was effected by other words not known to us. But this statement cannot stand, because the blessing of the consecration is now performed by reciting the things which were then accomplished; hence, if the consecration was not performed then by these words, neither would it be now.",
                        "Accordingly, others have maintained that this blessing was effected by the same words as are used now; but that Christ spoke them twice, at first secretly, in order to consecrate, and afterwards openly, to instruct others. But even this will not hold good, because the priest in consecrating uses these words, not as spoken in secret, but as openly pronounced. Accordingly, since these words have no power except from Christ pronouncing them, it seems that Christ also consecrated by pronouncing them openly.",
                        "And therefore others said that the Evangelists did not always follow the precise order in their narrative as that in which things actually happened, as is seen from Augustine (De Consens. Evang. ii). Hence it is to be understood that the order of what took place can be expressed thus: \"Taking the bread He blessed it, saying: This is My body, and then He broke it, and gave it to His disciples.\" But the same sense can be had even without changing the words of the Gospel; because the participle \"saying\" implies sequence of the words uttered with what goes before. And it is not necessary for the sequence to be understood only with respect to the last word spoken, as if Christ had just then pronounced those words, when He gave it to His disciples; but the sequence can be understood with regard to all that had gone before; so that the sense is: \"While He was blessing, and breaking, and giving it to His disciples, He spoke the words, 'Take ye,'\" etc."

The priest, however, would sin gravely in consecrating the sacrament thus, as he would not be observing the rite of the Church. Nor does the comparison with Baptism prove anything; for it is a sacrament of necessity: whereas the lack of this sacrament can be supplied by the spiritual partaking thereof, as Augustine says (cf.

                "I answer that, This sacrament differs from the other sacraments in two respects. First of all, in this, that this sacrament is accomplished by the consecration of the matter, while the rest are perfected in the use of the consecrated matter. Secondly, because in the other sacraments the consecration of the matter consists only in a blessing, from which the matter consecrated derives instrumentally a spiritual power, which through the priest who is an animated instrument, can pass on to inanimate instruments. But in this sacrament the consecration of the matter consists in the miraculous change of the substance, which can only be done by God; hence the minister in performing this sacrament has no other act save the pronouncing of the words. And because the form should suit the thing, therefore the form of this sacrament differs from the forms of the other sacraments in two respects. First, because the form of the other sacraments implies the use of the matter, as for instance, baptizing, or signing; but the form of this sacrament implies merely the consecration of the matter, which consists in transubstantiation, as when it is said, \"This is My body,\" or, \"This is the chalice of My blood.\" Secondly, because the forms of the other sacraments are pronounced in the person of the minister, whether by way of exercising an act, as when it is said, \"I baptize thee,\" or \"I confirm thee,\" etc.; or by way of command, as when it is said in the sacrament of order, \"Take the power,\" etc.; or by way of entreaty, as when in the sacrament of Extreme  Unction it is said, \"By this anointing and our intercession,\" etc. But the form of this sacrament is pronounced as if Christ were speaking in person, so that it is given to be understood that the minister does nothing in perfecting this sacrament, except to pronounce the words of Christ."

                "I answer that, This is the proper form for the consecration of the bread. For it was said (Article [1]) that this consecration consists in changing the substance of bread into the body of Christ. Now the form of a sacrament ought to denote what is done in the sacrament. Consequently the form for the consecration of the bread ought to signify the actual conversion of the bread into the body of Christ. And herein are three things to be considered: namely, the actual conversion, the term \"whence,\" and the term \"whereunto.\"",
                "Now the conversion can be considered in two ways: first, in \"becoming,\" secondly, in \"being.\" But the conversion ought not to be signified in this form as in \"becoming,\" but as in \"being.\" First, because such conversion is not successive, as was said above (Question [75], Article [7]), but instantaneous; and in such changes the \"becoming\" is nothing else than the \"being.\" Secondly, because the sacramental forms bear the same relation to the signification of the sacramental effect as artificial forms to the representation of the effect of art. Now an artificial form is the likeness of the ultimate effect, on which the artist's intention is fixed ;. just as the art-form in the builder's mind is principally the form of the house constructed, and secondarily of the constructing. Accordingly, in this form also the conversion ought to be expressed as in \"being,\" to which the intention is referred.",
                "And since the conversion is expressed in this form as in \"being,\" it is necessary for the extremes of the conversion to be signified as they exist in the fact of conversion. But then the term \"whereunto\" has the proper nature of its own substance; whereas the term \"whence\" does not remain in its own substance, but only as to the accidents whereby it comes under the senses, and can be determined in relation to the senses. Hence the term \"whence\" of  the conversion is conveniently expressed by the demonstrative pronoun, relative to the sensible accidents which continue; but the term \"whereunto\" is expressed by the noun signifying the nature of the thing which terminates the conversion, and this is Christ's entire body, and not merely His flesh; as was said above (Question [76], Article [1], ad 2). Hence this form is most appropriate: \"This is My body.\""

First and principally for securing our eternal heritage, according to Heb. 10:19: \"Having confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ\"; and in order to denote this, we say, \"of the New and Eternal Testament.\" Secondly, for justifying by grace, which is by faith according to Rm. 3:25,26: \"Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in His blood . . . that He Himself may be just, and the justifier of him who is of the faith of Jesus Christ\": and on this account we add, \"The Mystery of Faith.\" Thirdly, for removing sins which are the impediments to both of these things, according to Heb. 9:14: \"The blood of Christ . . . shall cleanse our conscience from dead works,\" that is, from sins; and on this account, we say, \"which shall be shed for you and for many unto the forgiveness of sins.\""

Some have said that in this expression, \"This is My body,\" the word \"this\" implies demonstration as conceived, and not as exercised, because the whole phrase is taken materially, since it is uttered by a way of narration: for the priest relates that Christ said: \"This is My body.\"",
                "But such a view cannot hold good, because then these words would not be applied to the corporeal matter present, and consequently the sacrament would not be valid: for Augustine says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.): \"The word is added to the element, and this becomes a sacrament.\" Moreover this solution ignores entirely the difficulty which this question presents: for there is still the objection in regard to the first uttering of these words by Christ; since it is evident that then they were employed, not materially, but significatively. And therefore it must be said that even when spoken by the priest they are taken significatively, and not merely materially. Nor does it matter that the priest pronounces them by way of recital, as though they were spoken by Christ, because owing to Christ's infinite power, just as through contact with His flesh the regenerative power entered not only into the waters which came into contact with Christ, but into all waters throughout the whole world and during all future ages, so likewise from Christ's uttering these words they derived their consecrating power, by whatever priest they be uttered, as if Christ present were saying them.",
                "And therefore others have said that in this phrase the word \"this\" appeals, not to the senses, but to the intellect; so that the meaning is, \"This is My body\"---i.e. \"The thing signified by 'this' is My body.\" But neither can this stand, because, since in the sacraments the effect is that which is signified, from such a form it would not result that Christ's body was in very truth in this sacrament, but merely as in a sign, which is heretical, as stated above (Question [85], Article [1]).",
                "Consequently, others have said that the word \"this\" appeals to the senses; not at the precise instant of its being uttered, but merely at the last instant thereof; as when a man says, \"Now I am silent,\" this adverb \"now\" points to the instant immediately following the speech: because the sense is: \"Directly these words are spoken I am silent.\" But neither can this hold good, because in that case the meaning of the sentence would be: \"My body is My body,\" which the above phrase does not effect, because this was so even before the utterance of the words: hence neither does the aforesaid sentence mean this.",
                "Consequently, then, it remains to be said, as stated above (Article [4]), that this sentence possesses the power of effecting the conversion of the bread into the body of Christ. And therefore it is compared to other sentences, which have power only of signifying and not of producing, as the concept of the practical intellect, which is productive of the thing, is compared to the concept of our speculative intellect which is drawn from things. because \"words are signs of concepts,\" as the Philosopher says (Peri Herm. i). And therefore as the concept of the practical intellect does not presuppose the thing understood, but makes it, so the truth of this expression does not presuppose the thing signified, but makes it; for such is the relation of God's word to the things made by the Word. Now this change takes place not successively, but in an instant, as stated above (Question [77], Article [7]). Consequently one must understand the aforesaid expression with reference to the last instant of the words being spoken, yet not so that the subject may be understood to have stood for that which is the term of the conversion; viz. that the body of Christ is the body of Christ; nor again that the subject be understood to stand for that which it was before the conversion, namely, the bread. but for that which is commonly related to both, i.e. that which is contained in general under those species. For these words do not make the body of Christ to be the body of Christ, nor do they make the bread to be the body of Christ; but what was contained under those species, and was formerly bread, they make to be the body of Christ. And therefore expressly our Lord did not say: \"This bread is My body,\" which would be the meaning of the second opinion; nor \"This My body is My body,\" which would be the meaning of the third opinion: but in general: \"This is My body,\" assigning no noun on the part of the subject, but only a pronoun, which signifies substance in common, without quality, that is, without a determinate form."

                "I answer that, Some of the earlier doctors said that these two forms, namely, for consecrating the bread and the wine, await each other's action, so that the first does not produce its effect until  the second be uttered.",
                "But this cannot stand, because, as stated above (Article [5], ad 3), for the truth of this phrase, \"This is My body,\" wherein the verb is in the present tense, it is required for the thing signified to be present simultaneously in time with the signification of the expression used; otherwise, if the thing signified had to be awaited for afterwards, a verb of the future tense would be employed, and not one of the present tense, so that we should not say, \"This is My body,\" but \"This will be My body.\" But the signification of this speech is complete directly those words are spoken. And therefore the thing signified must be present instantaneously, and such is the effect of this sacrament; otherwise it would not be a true speech. Moreover, this opinion is against the rite of the Church, which forthwith adores the body of Christ after the words are uttered.",
                "Hence it must be said that the first form does not await the second in its action, but has its effect on the instant."
