First, on account of His nearness to God His grace is the highest and first, though not in time, since all have received grace on account of His grace, according to Rm. 8:29: \"For whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be made conformable to the image of His Son; that He might be the first-born amongst many brethren.\" Secondly, He had perfection as regards the fulness of all graces, according to Jn. 1:14, \"We saw Him [Vulg.: 'His glory'] . . . full of grace and truth,\" as was shown, Question [7], Article [9]. Thirdly, He has the power of bestowing grace on all the members of the Church, according to Jn. 1:16: \"Of His fulness we have all received.\" And thus it is plain that Christ is fittingly called the Head of the Church."

For, as is written (James 2:20): \"Faith without works is dead.\" Yet such as these receive from Christ a certain vital act, i.e. to believe, as if a lifeless limb were moved by a man to some extent."

We must therefore consider the members of the mystical body not only as they are in act, but as they are in potentiality. Nevertheless, some are in potentiality who will never be reduced to act, and some are reduced at some time to act; and this according to the triple class, of which the first is by faith, the second by the charity of this life, the third by the fruition of the life to come. Hence we must say that if we take the whole time of the world in general, Christ is the Head of all men, but diversely. For, first and principally, He is the Head of such as are united to Him by glory; secondly, of those who are actually  united to Him by charity; thirdly, of those who are actually united to Him by faith; fourthly, of those who are united to Him merely in potentiality, which is not yet reduced to act, yet will be reduced to act according to Divine predestination; fifthly, of those who are united to Him in potentiality, which will never be reduced to act; such are those men existing in the world, who are not predestined, who, however, on their departure from this world, wholly cease to be members of Christ, as being no longer in potentiality to be united to Christ."

Now of all this multitude Christ is the Head, since He is nearer God, and shares His gifts more fully, not only than man, but even than angels; and of His influence not only men but even angels partake, since it is written (Eph. 1:20-22): that God the Father set \"Him,\" namely Christ, \"on His right hand in the heavenly places, above all Principality and Power and Virtue and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.

Nevertheless, as Augustine says (Tract. xlvii), \"He gave to His members to be shepherds; yet none of us calleth himself the Door. He kept this for Himself alone.\" And this because by door is implied the principal authority, inasmuch as it is by the door that all enter the house; and it is Christ alone by \"Whom also we have access . . . into this grace, wherein we stand\" (Rm. 5:2); but by the other names above-mentioned there may be implied not merely the principal but also the secondary authority."

First, by a certain intrinsic influence, inasmuch as motive and sensitive force flow from the head to the other members; secondly, by a certain exterior guidance, inasmuch as by sight and the senses, which are rooted in the head, man is guided in his exterior acts. Now the interior influx of grace is from no one save Christ, Whose manhood, through its union with the Godhead, has the power of justifying; but the influence over the members of the Church, as regards their exterior guidance, can belong to others; and in this way others may be called heads of the Church, according to Amos 6:1, \"Ye great men, heads of the people\"; differently, however, from Christ. First, inasmuch as Christ is the Head of all who pertain to the Church in every place and time and state; but all other men are called heads with reference to certain special places, as bishops of their Churches. Or with reference to a determined time as the Pope is the head of the whole Church, viz. during the time of his Pontificate, and with reference to a determined state, inasmuch as they are in the state of wayfarers. Secondly, because Christ is the Head of the Church by His own power and authority; while others are called heads, as taking Christ's place, according to 2 Cor. 2:10, \"For what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything, for your sakes I have done it in the person of Christ,\" and 2 Cor. 5:20, \"For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God, as it were, exhorting by us.\""

And in this way the devil is head of all the wicked. For, as is written (Job 41:25): \"He is king over all the children of pride.\" Now it belongs to a governor to lead those whom he governs to their end. But the end of the devil is the aversion of the rational creature from God; hence from the beginning he has endeavored to lead man from obeying the Divine precept. But aversion from God has the nature of an end, inasmuch as it is sought for under the appearance of liberty, according to Jer. 2:20: \"Of old time thou hast broken my yoke, thou hast burst my bands, and thou saidst, 'I will not serve.'\" Hence, inasmuch as some are brought to this end by sinning, they fall under the rule and government of the devil, and therefore he is called their head."
