The other kind of adoption imitates natural sonship imperfectly, and is called \"simple adoption,\" and by this the adopted does not come under the power of the adopter: so that it is a disposition to perfect adoption, rather than perfect adoption itself. In this way even one who is not his own master can adopt, without the consent of the sovereign and with the authority of a magistrate: and one who is thus adopted does not inherit the estate of the adopter, nor is the latter bound to bequeath to him any of his goods in his will, unless he will.",

And since taking implies a term \"wherefrom,\" for which reason the taker is not the thing taken, it follows that the person taken as a child must be a stranger. Accordingly, just as natural procreation has a term \"whereto,\" namely the form which is the end of generation, and a term \"wherefrom,\" namely the contrary form, so legal generation has a term \"whereto,\" namely a child or grandchild, and a term \"wherefrom,\" namely, a stranger. Consequently the above definition  includes the genus of adoption, for it is described as a \"lawful taking,\" and the term \"wherefrom,\" since it is said to be the taking of \"a stranger,\" and the term \"whereto,\" because it says, \"as a child or grandchild .\""

Hence it is that legal adoption is an impediment to marriage.

Accordingly the first and third relationships are perpetual impediments to marriage: but the second is not, but only so long as the adopted person remains under the power of the adoptive father, wherefore when the father dies or when the child comes of age, they can be married."
