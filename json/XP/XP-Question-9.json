But in so far as it is part of a sacrament, it subordinates the penitent to the priest who has the keys of the Church, and who by means of the confession knows the conscience of the person confessing. In this way it is possible for confession to be in one who is not contrite, for he can make his sins known to the priest, and subject himself to the keys of the Church: and though he does not receive the fruit of absolution then, yet he will begin to receive it, when he is sincerely contrite, as happens in the other sacraments: wherefore he is not bound to repeat his confession, but to confess his lack of sincerity."

And as in Baptism, in order to signify the inward washing, we employ that element which is chiefly used in washing, so in the sacramental act which is intended for manifestation we generally make use of that act which is most commonly employed for the purpose of manifestation, viz. our own words; for other ways have been introduced as supplementary to this."

                "I answer that, Some of the above conditions are essential to confession, and some are requisite for its well-being. Now those things which are essential to confession belong to it either as to an act of virtue, or as to part of a sacrament. If in the first way, it is either by reason of virtue in general, or by reason of the special virtue of which it is the act, or by reason of the act itself. Now there are four conditions of virtue in general, as stated in Ethic. ii, 4. The first is knowledge, in respect of which confession is said to be \"discreet,\" inasmuch as prudence is required in every act of virtue: and this discretion consists in giving greater weight to greater sins. The second condition is choice, because acts of virtue should be voluntary, and in this respect confession is said to be \"voluntary.\" The third condition  is that the act be done for a particular purpose, viz. the due end, and in this respect confession is said to be \"pure,\" i.e. with a right intention. The fourth condition is that one should act immovably, and in this respect it is said that confession should be \"courageous,\" viz. that the truth should not be forsaken through shame.",
                "Now confession is an act of the virtue of penance. First of all it takes its origin in the horror which one conceives for the shamefulness of sin, and in this respect confession should be \"full of shame,\" so as not to be a boastful account of one's sins, by reason of some worldly vanity accompanying it. Then it goes on to deplore the sin committed, and in this respect it is said to be \"tearful.\" Thirdly, it culminates in self-abjection, and in this respect it should be \"humble,\" so that one confesses one's misery and weakness.",
                "By reason of its very nature, viz. confession, this act is one of manifestation: which manifestation can be hindered by four things: first, by falsehood, and in this respect confession is said to be \"faithful,\" i.e. true. Secondly, by the use of vague words, and against this confession is said to be \"open,\" so as not to be wrapped up in vague words; thirdly, by \"multiplicity\" of words, in which respect it is said to be \"simple\" indicating that the penitent should relate only such matters as affect the gravity of the sin; fourthly none of those things should be suppressed which should be made known, and in this respect confession should be \"entire.\"",
                "In so far as confession is part of a sacrament it is subject to the judgment of the priest who is the minister of the sacrament. Wherefore it should be an \"accusation\" on the part of the penitent, should manifest his \"readiness to obey\" the priest, should be \"secret\" as regards the nature of the court wherein the hidden affairs of conscience are tried.",
                "The well-being of confession requires that it should be \"frequent\"; and \"not delayed,\" i.e. that the sinner should confess at once."
